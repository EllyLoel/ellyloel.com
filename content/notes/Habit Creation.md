## The Habit loop

### 1. Decide on a cue

- Pick the thing that tells you its time to do the habit (an alarm, visual reminder, another habit, etc)
- Ideally, a cue is:
	- clear (you wont miss it, even in a hurry)
	- consistent (same cue every time)
	- doable (you’ll be in a place where you can do it)

### 2. Figure out the habits routine

- break down the habit into steps. (this will help you prepare & avoid obstacles once you begin)
- how do I know what the routine should be?
	- consider your goals for the habit
	- don’t be afraid to to start small
	- if you need to know more, maybe build learning into your routine so it doesn’t keep you from starting
	- rough it out! the steps will totally change, this just gives you a place to start
- after you’ve identified the routine, make a list of the stuff you’ll need to complete it! (then find/download/order/collect it so you’ll have it)

### 3. Choose your reward!
- choose a small reward for doing the thing (to help your brain want to do it again!)
- Uh… why do I need a reward?
	- Sometimes just doing the habit is enough of an (intrinsic) reward
	- if not, add an extrinsic reward!
	- it doesn’t have to be big, but it does need to be immediate enough that the brain connects doing the thing to getting the reward!
	- so if working toward a bigger goal, consider smaller rewards (stickers! points!… smoothies!) along the way
	- if possible, work the reward into your routine

### 4. Tweak as necessary
- keep playing with it til you find what works for you
- ideas for tweaking:
	- keep forgetting to do it? try a stronger cue. (ones that stand out as weird work especially well!)
	- feeling daunted or overwhelmed? simplify the routine (even 1 minute/day is a great place to start!)
	- just don’t wanna? try a more exciting/immediate reward (and make sure you get it! the goal is for your brain to start anticipating the reward & wanting to do the thing!)
