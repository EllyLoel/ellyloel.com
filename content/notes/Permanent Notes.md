Permanent Notes in a [[Zettelkasten]] should follow this framework...

- One idea per note - but as complete as possible in your own words
- Write as if you are writing for someone else - use full sentences, show sources.
- Be precise, clear and brief
- Should be understood even if you don't know the context it was taken from.
