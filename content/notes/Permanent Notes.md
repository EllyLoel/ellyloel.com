Everyday you should go through your inbox and seek to refine the [[Fleeting notes]] & [[Literature notes]] that you've taken. Making connections and turning them into permanent notes.

Ideally this should happen roughly everyday so that you don't forget the conceptual ideas behind the notes.

> Developing > Collecting

Your [[Zettelkasten]] isn't just for collecting all of your ideas, it is meant to develop your ideas and help expand your understanding. When you add a new permanent note there are a number of things you need to think about:

- Whether it
  - contradicts;
  - corrects;
  - supports;
  - or adds to what you've got in both your [[Zettelkasten]] and your mind?
- Can you combine ideas to generate something new?
- What questions are triggered by them?

These are important questions to answer as if you ignore them you will end up with a [[Zettelkasten]] that is lacking these kind of horizontally generated ideas.

> One idea = One note

> One note = One idea

Your permanent notes should only encompass a single idea, so as not to cause overlapping which will cause issues when you try to piece together your permanent notes into a whole piece of content.

**Rules for a permanent note:**

- One idea
- Full sentences
- Disclose sources
- Make references
- Try to be as
  - precise;
  - clear;
  - and brief as you can be.
