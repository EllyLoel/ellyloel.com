As lovely as it might seem, our selfless actions usually get prioritised above looking after ourselves. We will go to unending lengths to look after the ones we love, and even the ones we don't. We are empaths, we want the best for everyone, so we do our best to try and give them that, usually to our own detriment through self neglect.
