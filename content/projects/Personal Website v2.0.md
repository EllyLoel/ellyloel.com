This is version 2.0 of my personal website, which contains a portfolio, resume & digital garden. I built it with many fresh [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) features such as [Dynamic Images](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/using-gatsby-plugin-image/#dynamic-images), [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) & [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
