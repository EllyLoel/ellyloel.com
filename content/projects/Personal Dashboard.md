In this project I used a number of REST APIs ([NASA APOD](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod), [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api), [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#quotable)) as well as the [Geolocation Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to create a personal dashboard, which can be installed as a Chrome extension.
