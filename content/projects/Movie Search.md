I completed this project during the second part of the [React Basics](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) module from [The Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). It was first built with a mix of class based components & functional components with [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) but I refactored it to use only functional components.
