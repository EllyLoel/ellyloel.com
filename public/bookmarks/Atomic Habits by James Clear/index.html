			<h1>Atomic Habits by James Clear</h1>
<ul>
<li>1% Increases build up.
<ul>
<li>If you made a 1% increase everyday for a year you'd be 37 times better by the end of the year.</li>
<li><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FEllys-Life%2FsCYH8hSydj.png?alt=media&amp;token=6c67f0ad-a07a-4046-90cb-4c4d68edadbd" alt=""></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You don't need to make one earth shattering improvement, just lots of small ones.</li>
<li>Habits are the compound interest of life.</li>
<li>Doing personal study on one day won't do much but if you do it for a month or a year it could change your life.</li>
<li>The effects of your habits multiply</li>
<li>It's easy to let bad habits slide because you don't immediately see the negative effects.</li>
<li>Making a choice that's 1% better or 1% worse seems insignificant in the moment but over the span of moments that make up a life time these choices make up the difference between who you are and who you could be.</li>
<li>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
<ul>
<li>Net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits.</li>
<li>Weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits.</li>
<li>Knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.</li>
<li>Clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure, it will multiply what ever you feed it.</li>
<li>Good habits make time your ally, bad habits make time your enemy.</li>
<li>Productivity compounds
<ul>
<li>Accomplishing one more task is a small feat on any given day but it counts for a lot over an entire career.</li>
<li>The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater.
<ul>
<li>The more tasks you can handle without thinking the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knowledge compounds
<ul>
<li>Learning one new idea won't make you a genius but a commitment to life long learning can be transformative.
<ul>
<li>Each book your read not only teaches you something new but opens up other ways of thinking about old ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Negative thoughts compound.
<ul>
<li>The more you think of yourself and worthless, stupid or ugly the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way; you get trapped in a thought loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What progress is really like.
<ul>
<li>Break through moments a usually the result of many previous actions which unlock the potential to unless a major change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forget about goals focus on systems instead.
<ul>
<li>Systems are the processes that lead to your goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
