<p>The mental processes people rely on to self regulate. The executive functions enable a person to control their thoughts, words, actions and emotions. They also assist them to perceive and manage time, and to direct and manage their behaviour over time.</p>
<p>In [[ADHD]] brains the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls executive function, develops 30% slower, this translates to being about 3-6 years behind [[Neurotypical]] brains. Even once it has fully developed it is still impaired.</p>
