			<p>The mental processes people rely on to self regulate. The executive functions enable a person to control their thoughts, words, actions and emotions. They also assist them to perceive and manage time, and to direct and manage their behaviour over time.</p>
<p>In [[ADHD]] brains the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls executive function, develops 30% slower, this translates to being about 3-6 years behind [[Neurotypical]] brains. Even once it has fully developed it is still impaired.</p>
<h2>Response inhibition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stops you from making circumstantially offensive decisions.</li>
<li>Stop you from making choices that interfere with your goals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Working memory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is for the short term storage and manipulation of information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Set shifting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the ability to switch back and forward between different tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Delay aversion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Makes you want things as soon as possible which results in preference for small immediate over large delayed rewards.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cognitive flexibility</h2>
<ul>
<li>Helps us to sustain or shift attention in response to different demands or to apply different rules in different settings.</li>
</ul>
