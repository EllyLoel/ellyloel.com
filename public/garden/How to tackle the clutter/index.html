<h1>How to tackle the clutter</h1>
<p>We might have done a lot but we havenâ€™t actually gotten anything we wanted/needed done.</p>
<ol>
<li>Divide a piece of paper up into boxes, one for each room.</li>
<li>Then list everything that needs to be done in each room.</li>
<li>Finally make copies of this, because youâ€™re definitely going to be in this situation again and this will help you then!</li>
<li>Start in the room that overwhelms you the least</li>
<li>Take it one bit at a time</li>
<li>While cleaning, if you find a distraction place it aside to come back to once youâ€™re done</li>
</ol>
