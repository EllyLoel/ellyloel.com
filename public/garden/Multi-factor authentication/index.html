<li>The most common types of MFA use:
<ul>
<li>A one-time verification code that is sent to a phone number or email address</li>
<li>The answer to a security question, such as the first concert you attended or the place you were born</li>
<li>A time-based, one-time password (TOTP) that is generated by an authenticator app, like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile&amp;hl=en_US">DuoMobile</a></li>
<li>A physical fob, like <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikey</a>, which can be plugged into your device</li>
<li>Biometric information, such as a fingerprint or iris scan (not common).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some types of MFA are more secure than others:
<ul>
<li>Two-factor authentication that relies on SMS is vulnerable to being compromised through a SIM swap attack, hackers persuade or bribe phone company employees to transfer your phone number to another SIM.</li>
<li>Knowledge-based MFA tests like security questions are also more vulnerable to attacks. Your mother’s maiden name or the city in which you were born, for instance, are a matter of public record.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Best MFA options:
<ul>
<li>Hardware MFA options like Yubikey are the most secure, but currently few services support it.</li>
<li>For the time being, the best method of MFA is an authenticator app. These apps work by generating a hash based on the time and a secret key, which only your phone and the website’s servers know. This hash is then shortened to a six-digit number for you to type in to a window following the username and password page at sign in.</li>
</ul>
