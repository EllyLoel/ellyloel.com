<p>Everyday you should go through your inbox and seek to refine the [[Fleeting notes]] &amp; [[Literature notes]] that you've taken. Making connections and turning them into permanent notes.</p>
<p>Ideally this should happen roughly everyday so that you don't forget the conceptual ideas behind the notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developing &gt; Collecting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your [[Zettelkasten]] isn't just for collecting all of your ideas, it is meant to develop your ideas and help expand your understanding. When you add a new permanent note there are a number of things you need to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether it
<ul>
<li>contradicts;</li>
<li>corrects;</li>
<li>supports;</li>
<li>or adds to what you've got in both your [[Zettelkasten]] and your mind?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you combine ideas to generate something new?</li>
<li>What questions are triggered by them?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are important questions to answer as if you ignore them you will end up with a [[Zettelkasten]] that is lacking these kind of horizontally generated ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One idea = One note</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One note = One idea</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your permanent notes should only encompass a single idea, so as not to cause overlapping which will cause issues when you try to piece together your permanent notes into a whole piece of content.</p>
<p><strong>Rules for a permanent note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One idea</li>
<li>Full sentences</li>
<li>Disclose sources</li>
<li>Make references</li>
<li>Try to be as
<ul>
<li>precise;</li>
<li>clear;</li>
<li>and brief as you can be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
