<ul>
<li>What is a passphrase?
<ul>
<li>While everybody knows what is a password, fewer people know about passphrases. A passphrase is a kind of password that uses a series of words, separated by spaces or not (it doesn’t really matter). “correcthorsebatterystaple” is the passphrase in the comic. Although passphrases often contain more characters than passwords do, passphrases contain fewer “components” (four words instead of, say, 12 random characters). This makes passphrases easier to remember, typically by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic">mnemonic device</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So which is better?
<ul>
<li>Both passwords and passphrases can be secure, and if you are using a password manager, the security and usability differences between passwords and passphrases will not be significant. However, if you are setting a password that you must remember by heart, for usability reasons, I recommend using passphrases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you use passphrases, keep the following in mind:
<ul>
<li>Four words should be sufficient. Five words is better.</li>
<li>Don’t choose from the most common words, and don’t choose quotes or sayings. The words should be as random as possible.</li>
<li>Use a unique passphrase for every account you own. That way, if one passphrase is ever exposed, the other accounts remain secure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Master passphrase for your [[Password managers]] account, then individual complex long random passwords for each account.</h2>
