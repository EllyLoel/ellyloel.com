<h1>Estimating time for tasks</h1>
<p>Set an alarm to go off every 10 minutes or which ever chunk of time works best for you.</p>
<p>Account for breaks</p>
<p>Use time tracking apps
Time yourself

<p>Combine the steps to make a schedule
Check you have the time in your schedule</p>
<p>Decide Who You Need to Involve
Gather everyone involved
Get feedback on your estimation
Estimate someone else's time</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine how long you think it would take someone else to complete the task.

</ul>
<p>Use a three point estimation</p>
<ul>

<li>worst-case scenario</li>
<li>most realistic scenario
Use Three-Point Estimations</li>
</ul>
<p>Understand What's Required
List all the steps
Bottom-Up/Inside view estimating: break it down into atomic tasks
Top-down/Outside view estimating: look back on previous projects that might be similar shape/size/complexity and see how long they took
Estimate the time required for each step
Order These Activities</p>
<p>Add in extra time
Always overestimate your time requirements 2x-3x
Estimate in Ranges</p>
<ul>
<li>multiply  &amp; divide your estimate by 4, that gives you the lower-end and upper-end of your range.
Calculate Your Fudge Ratio
Create and refine your fudge ratio (actual time/estimated time)
Make your estimate when you're feeling tired or unmotivated</li>
</ul>
<p>Track your confidence in the estimation and use that to get a better picture of what different levels of confidence indicate</p>
