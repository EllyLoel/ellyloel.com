<h2>The Habit loop</h2>
<h3>1. Decide on a cue</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick the thing that tells you its time to do the habit (an alarm, visual reminder, another habit, etc)</li>
<li>Ideally, a cue is:
<ul>
<li>clear (you wont miss it, even in a hurry)</li>
<li>consistent (same cue every time)</li>
<li>doable (you’ll be in a place where you can do it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Figure out the habits routine</h3>
<ul>
<li>break down the habit into steps. (this will help you prepare &amp; avoid obstacles once you begin)</li>
<li>how do I know what the routine should be?
<ul>
<li>consider your goals for the habit</li>
<li>don’t be afraid to to start small</li>
<li>if you need to know more, maybe build learning into your routine so it doesn’t keep you from starting</li>
<li>rough it out! the steps will totally change, this just gives you a place to start</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>after you’ve identified the routine, make a list of the stuff you’ll need to complete it! (then find/download/order/collect it so you’ll have it)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Choose your reward!</h3>
<ul>
<li>choose a small reward for doing the thing (to help your brain want to do it again!)</li>
<li>Uh… why do I need a reward?
<ul>
<li>Sometimes just doing the habit is enough of an (intrinsic) reward</li>
<li>if not, add an extrinsic reward!</li>
<li>it doesn’t have to be big, but it does need to be immediate enough that the brain connects doing the thing to getting the reward!</li>
<li>so if working toward a bigger goal, consider smaller rewards (stickers! points!… smoothies!) along the way</li>
<li>if possible, work the reward into your routine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Tweak as necessary</h3>
<ul>
<li>keep playing with it til you find what works for you</li>
<li>ideas for tweaking:
<ul>
<li>keep forgetting to do it? try a stronger cue. (ones that stand out as weird work especially well!)</li>
<li>feeling daunted or overwhelmed? simplify the routine (even 1 minute/day is a great place to start!)</li>
<li>just don’t wanna? try a more exciting/immediate reward (and make sure you get it! the goal is for your brain to start anticipating the reward &amp; wanting to do the thing!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
