<p>We don't experience time in the same way the [[neurotypical]] people do, we have no internal sense of the flow of time. That is why we're constantly in situations where we're late, whether it's for a deadline or an event.</p>
<p>The only two times that we comprehend are <strong>now</strong> and <strong>not now</strong>, and unfortunately even when things are now sometimes they're interpreted as not now.</p>
