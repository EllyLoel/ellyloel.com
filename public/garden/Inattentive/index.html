<p>Unable to focus in classes/meetings/conversations due to the lack of stimulation. We don't dislike you or find you boring we just require more stimuli to be able to stay focused.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing games while chatting to friends</li>
<li>Watching out the window while in class</li>
<li>Listening to music while studying/working</li>
<li>Fidgeting/stimming while in a meeting</li>
</ul>
