			<h2>1. Reference/File system</h2>
<p>These are the processes and systems for storing both <strong><em>physical documents</em></strong> as well as <strong><em>digital documents and information</em></strong>.</p>
<h3>Solutions/approaches include:</h3>

<h2>2. Project Management</h2>
<p>A <strong><em>project</em></strong> is an activity that has a beginning and end, contains multiple steps, and performs something new or unique. A project will often involve multiple resources, costs, and require detailed tracking. Projects also have “<strong><em>dependencies</em></strong>”, which is where the start of certain steps is dependent upon the completion of prior steps.</p>
<h3>Solutions/approaches include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Project Management Applications (Microsoft Project, Trello, Asana, Wrike, Basecamp).</li>
<li>Spreadsheet Tracking (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SmartSheets ).</li>
<li>Written Project Plans with detailed Milestones (Microsoft Word, Google Docs).</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Process Management</h2>
<p>A <strong><em>process</em></strong> is a specific activity (or set of activities) performed repeatedly to achieve a desired result. It is critical that processes are clearly documented and consistently followed.</p>
<h3>Solutions/approaches include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Written Process Flows (Microsoft Word, Google Docs)</li>

<h2>4. Task Management</h2>
<p><strong><em>Tasks</em></strong> are discrete items that need to be prioritized and completed. They are what I like to call “<strong><em>one and done</em></strong>” activities. <a href="http://www.emailoverloadsolutions.com/blog/microsoft-outlook-tasks-a-primer">Tasks can be a single, stand-alone item</a> that needs to be performed. Tasks are also often the result of &quot;projects&quot;, which require completion of individual “tasks”.</p>
<h3>Solutions/approaches include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Manual Systems (Paper-based planners and check-lists).</li>
<li>Spreadsheet Tracking (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SmartSheets).</li>
<li>Dedicated Task Management Applications (ToDoist, Wunderlist, Rememberthemilk).</li>

<h3>Solutions/approaches include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Manual Systems (Paper-based planners or calendars)</li>
<li>Dedicated Calendar Applications (Google Calendar, Sunrise)</li>
<li>Integrated Solutions (Microsoft Outlook, Google Apps, IBM Lotus Notes)</li>

<h2>6. Communication Management</h2>
