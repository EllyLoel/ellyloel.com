<h2>2. Project Management</h2>
<p>A <strong><em>project</em></strong> is an activity that has a beginning and end, contains multiple steps, and performs something new or unique. A project will often involve multiple resources, costs, and require detailed tracking. Projects also have “<strong><em>dependencies</em></strong>”, which is where the start of certain steps is dependent upon the completion of prior steps.</p>

<h2>4. Task Management</h2>
<p><strong><em>Tasks</em></strong> are discrete items that need to be prioritized and completed. They are what I like to call “<strong><em>one and done</em></strong>” activities. <a href="http://www.emailoverloadsolutions.com/blog/microsoft-outlook-tasks-a-primer">Tasks can be a single, stand-alone item</a> that needs to be performed. Tasks are also often the result of &quot;projects&quot;, which require completion of individual “tasks”.</p>
