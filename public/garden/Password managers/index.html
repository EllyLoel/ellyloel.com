<li>Why use a password manager?
<ul>
<li>Password managers greatly improve your online security by allowing you to create a different password for every individual account you have on the internet. This ensures that if any one password is ever compromised, all your other accounts will remain secure.</li>
<li>Additionally, password managers allow you to create complex (and thus secure) passwords that humans would find very hard to remember.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which password manager should you use?
<ul>
<li>I would personally recommend [[Bitwarden]] as they are an [[Open-source]] company with known good intentions as they have been audited multiple times by third-party sources.</li>
<li>On top of this they have an extensive free tier with many useful features.</li>
