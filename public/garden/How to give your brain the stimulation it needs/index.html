<h1>How to give your brain the stimulation it needs</h1>
<p>ADHD brains need a lot of stimulation</p>
<p>We donâ€™t spend hours on social media because we think itâ€™s a great use of our time, we do it because weâ€™re looking for the stimulation we need to function</p>
<p>Most quick &amp; easy dopamine sources we turn (youtube, tiktok, twitter, etc) to aren't actually enough to fulfill that need</p>
<p>itâ€™s really hard to make good dopamine choices when youâ€™re low on dopamine</p>
<p>Create a dopamine menu (Dopamenu)</p>
<ol>
<li>Design your menu
<ul>
<li>think about things that youâ€™ve done in the past that made you feel really excited or alive</li>
<li>what are your go-toâ€™s when youâ€™re bored that donâ€™t actually make you feel great</li>
<li>Entrees (the things that excite you/make you feel alive)</li>
<li>Desserts (things that are my go-toâ€™s that I tend to over do it on)</li>
<li>Appetisers (things that can give me a quick dopamine burst without sucking me in)</li>
<li>Sides (things I can add to other activities to make them more engaging)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prep
<ul>
<li>Make your entrees easy to start so that youâ€™re more likely to actually choose them</li>
<li>Make desserts harder to start so that you donâ€™t go for them over entrees all the time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advertise your dopamenu
<ul>
<li>make copies of it and put it in hard to miss places</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the things you once found enjoyable are no longer enjoyable then it could be depression</p>
