How can you tell? What does that mean? Where would you even start?\n\nI’d been making websites for over 20 years, and I didn’t understand what it was like to use the web with a cognitive disability until I developed one. After treatment to remove a slow-growing brain tumor, I had a hard time using most websites, including the ones I built! This real-world experience gave me a newfound perspective on accessibility, and I learned that there’s no better way to understand a user’s experience than living it. It also motivated me to learn new techniques that provide more accessible experiences for users with cognitive impairments and redesign parts of my sites with a focus on cognitive ease.\n\nThis session was in the Design Track.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nAlyssa Panetta has been designing and developing websites by hand since Y2K. She has worked for educational mathematics software companies and is currently a Web Designer/Developer for the University Libraries, University at Albany. After a diagnosis of brain cancer in 2020 and subsequent treatment, Alyssa started a website where she writes letters to her removed tumor that is preserved in a tumor research bank: deartalula.com.\n\nLearn more about axe-con at https://www.deque.com/axe-con/","note":"","type":"video","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lBe4WFqNW40/maxresdefault.jpg","media":[{"link":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lBe4WFqNW40/maxresdefault.jpg","type":"image"}],"tags":["A11y"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2023-06-28T11:15:00.301Z","lastUpdate":"2023-06-28T11:15:00.301Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"domain":"youtube.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":597983167,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":597643577,"link":"https://tetralogical.com/blog/2023/06/05/the-only-accessibility-specialist-in-the-room/","title":"The only accessibility specialist in the room - TetraLogical","excerpt":"Accessibility consultancy with a focus on inclusion.

In fact, I am very skeptical of AI myself, despite my role at Microsoft being that of an Accessibility Innovation Strategist helping run the AI for Accessibility grant program. As with any tool, AI can be used in very constructive, inclusive, and accessible ways and it can used in destructive, exclusive, and harmful ones. And there are a ton of uses somewhere in the mediocre middle as well.  I’d like you to consider this a “yes… and” piece to compliment Joe’s post. I don’t seek to refute any of what he’s saying, but rather provide some visibility to projects and opportunities where AI can make a meaningful difference for people with disabilities (PwD) across the globe. To be clear, I am not saying there aren’t real risks and pressing issues with AI that need to be addressed—there are, and we needed to address them like yesterday—but I want to take a little time to talk about what’s possible, in hopes we’ll get there one day.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2023-06-09/hero.jpg","media":[{"link":"https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2023-06-09/hero.jpg","type":"image"}],"tags":["A11y"],"highlights":[{"text":"I have no doubt that AI can and will harm people… today, tomorrow, and well into the future.
