The loose rule of estimation applied to these products has translated into something like $100 to $150 per braille cell. A 40-cell display, in other words, may cost $4,000 to $6,000, while an 80-cell model will cost $8,000 to $12,000. And so it has been that, while desirable, braille computer access has been out of reach for many users of assistive technology.It is thus of great value to lower the cost of individual braille cells in order to manufacture Refreshable Braille Devices at a price that is affordable to the Visually Impared community.While commercially available braille displays use expensive piezo-electric actuated pins. This project employs an electromechanical system with off-the-shelf and easily manufacturable components, leveraging the accessibility of high-quality 3D Printers and micro-magnets to keep the cost low without compromising functionality.Support my work by buying me a coffee ☕: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vjvaradaSource & Design files:  https://hackaday.io/project/191181-electromechanical-refreshable-braille-module#HackadayPrize #hackadayprize #braille #assistivetechnology #assistivetech","note":"","type":"video","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BXi1tG78AW4/sddefault.jpg","media":[{"link":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BXi1tG78AW4/sddefault.jpg","type":"image"},{"link":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BXi1tG78AW4/mqdefault.jpg","type":"image"}],"tags":["A11y"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2023-11-03T12:54:16.737Z","lastUpdate":"2023-11-03T12:55:01.567Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"domain":"youtube.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":672406141,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":667439274,"link":"https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2023/10/why-your-web-design-sucks/","title":"It's 2023, here is why your web design sucks.","excerpt":"Exploring the reasons why we no longer have web designers.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://heather-buchel.com/social-images/here-is-why-your-design-sucks.png","media":[{"link":"https://heather-buchel.com/social-images/here-is-why-your-design-sucks.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["Building websites","Design","Design Engineering","Development"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2023-10-25T09:42:47.387Z","lastUpdate":"2023-10-25T09:42:47.387Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"domain":"heather-buchel.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":667439274,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":657740224,"link":"https://danmall.com/posts/folly-of-design-system-foundations/","title":"“The Folly of Design System “Foundations”,” an article by Dan Mall","excerpt":"The idea of “foundations” is one of the biggest threats to creating a design system people use.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://danmall.com/static/img/posts/folly-of-design-system-foundations/folly-of-design-system-foundations.png","media":[{"link":"https://danmall.com/static/img/posts/folly-of-design-system-foundations/folly-of-design-system-foundations.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["Design Systems","Design Tokens"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2023-10-08T02:12:07.684Z","lastUpdate":"2023-10-08T02:12:07.684Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"domain":"danmall.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":657740224,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":657133851,"link":"https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-more-modern-css-reset/","title":"A (more) Modern CSS Reset - Andy Bell","excerpt":"I wrote A Modern CSS Reset almost 4 years ago and, yeh, it&#8217;s not aged overly well.

Then, they die. It doesn't have to be this way. Enshittification occurs when companies gobble each other up in an orgy of mergers and acquisitions, reducing the internet to \"five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four\" (credit to Tom Eastman!), which lets them endlessly tweak their back-ends to continue to shift value from users and business-customers to themselves. The government gets in on the act by banning tweaking by users - reverse-engineering, scraping, bots and other user-side self-help measures - leaving users helpless before the march of enshittification. We don't have to accept this!

Too often, they’re stuck in static design thinking, or adaptive layouts like mobile, tablet, and desktop.\n\nThe rise of design systems has helped, allowing for easy preview of responsive patterns. But our design tools aren’t yet equipped to allow designers to move easily from design to code. Where are the tools that allow for truly fluid layouts? What would they even look like?\n\nIn this talk, Jason will look at how our design processes have changed, how design tools should integrate with design systems, and how close we can get to an ideal fluid design tool today.","note":"","type":"video","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N0HeulsGVnM/maxresdefault.jpg","media":[{"link":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N0HeulsGVnM/maxresdefault.jpg","type":"image"}],"tags":["Building websites","Design","Development","Design Systems"],"important":false,"reminder":{"date":null},"removed":false,"created":"2023-09-06T06:55:21.582Z","lastUpdate":"2023-09-06T06:56:17.125Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"highlights":[],"domain":"youtube.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":641905092,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":640346447,"link":"https://uxdesign.cc/inclusive-design-guide-7-principles-of-designing-for-the-autistic-community-1e6dcd4bae85","title":"Designing for the autistic community","excerpt":"Product design principles that will improve usability for everyone.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*5KIW1oDWkIBwsn89sBibjg.png","media":[{"link":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*5KIW1oDWkIBwsn89sBibjg.png","type":"image"},{"link":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*5KIW1oDWkIBwsn89sBibjg.png","type":"image"},{"link":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*UrHasj0euIe030VmmnTdGA.png","type":"image"},{"link":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*Hlej4IkeEwQSEjz4j1SPJA.png","type":"image"},{"link":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*hu7cygB4zd3PrL50IvcDkQ.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["Autism","Design"],"important":false,"reminder":{"date":null},"removed":false,"created":"2023-09-03T23:28:28.849Z","lastUpdate":"2023-09-03T23:28:39.488Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"highlights":[],"domain":"uxdesign.cc","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":640346447,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":632490696,"link":"https://viewports.fyi/","title":"The ideal viewport doesn’t exist","excerpt":"Before you settle on basing design decisions on a handful of strict breakpoints, make sure you consider the vast fragmentation of screen sizes and browser viewports.","note":"","type":"link","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://viewports.fyi/images/social-share.png","media":[{"link":"https://viewports.fyi/images/social-share.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["Building websites","Design","Development"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2023-08-22T12:44:43.150Z","lastUpdate":"2023-08-22T12:44:43.150Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"domain":"viewports.fyi","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":632490696,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":628914519,"link":"https://complementary.space/#foreword","title":"Complementary Space","excerpt":"Design spacing tokens semantically","note":"","type":"link","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://complementary.space/og-image.jpg","media":[{"link":"https://complementary.space/og-image.jpg","type":"image"}],"tags":["Design Systems","Design Tokens","CSS"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2023-08-15T11:36:48.064Z","lastUpdate":"2023-08-15T11:36:48.064Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"domain":"complementary.space","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":628914519,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":628898069,"link":"https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/guides/screen-reader-ux.html","title":"Web: How to document the screen reader user experience - Accessibility, Your Team and You","excerpt":"User experience designers guide - How to document the screen reader user experience for web content.

On the one hand, it’s a tool that produces great results -- why not use it? On the other hand, you’re not getting better at writing -- that’s a problem, right?

Even if you don’t know who he is, you probably use products that were inspired by his thinking everyday. He wrote the Ten Principles for Good Design, and they’re basically like the design bible. Designers must never question them. So that’s exactly what we’re going to do now.\n\nEditing by Brad Heath: https://twitter.com/brad_heath_\n\nAll content directed and written by John Mauriello.
