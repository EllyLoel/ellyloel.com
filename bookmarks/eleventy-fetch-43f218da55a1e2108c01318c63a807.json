For my React Europe 2018 talk, I estimate that I spent over 150 hours on the talk; it consumed my mornings and weekends for a couple months.\n\nAssuming you make the median US software engineering salary of $104,000 a year, and put 150 hours of work into the talk, you’ve spent $7500 worth of your time getting it ready.\n\nIn addition, preparing a talk is a bumpy ride. There’s a bunch of stress along the way, a bunch of nights and weekends where you really don’t feel like working on it but do anyway, moments of crisis where you think your talk won’t work or isn’t interesting.\n\nFor all of that, conference talks tend to reach a surprisingly small audience. Most conference talks will be seen by a few hundred people live, and maybe another 1000 through the recording. Most of my blog posts get more views than that, and they take way less time to produce.\n\nSo on its face, the math doesn’t look favourable. Why spend so much time and energy on a conference presentation?\n\nIn my opinion, there are a few things that balance the scales:\n\nWhile relatively few people will see a conference talk, it can be a very impactful way to deliver a message. A well-crafted talk can inspire and motivate someone far more effectively than a tweet or blog post! For example, CodeSandbox(opens in new tab) was created by Ives Van Hoorne(opens in new tab) after attending React Europe, and he credits(opens in new tab) the conference with making him determined to build it!\nYou get to hang out with the other speakers. In many cases, these are the authors of the tools you use every day, or people whose work has inspired you for years.\nIt’s a tremendous way to make new friends who share your interests. After a conference talk, expect tons of folks to come up and ask pertinent follow-ups, or share some of the interesting things they’ve been doing.\nSpeaking at a conference makes people think that you’re a Real Expert™. It lends authority to what you’re saying. It can help you in your career for years to come.\nIt’s an experience. It’s a memory that you’ll have for the rest of your life, a Youtube video you’ll be able to watch when you're older. It’s a heck of a thing!","note":"","color":"yellow","created":"2024-12-05T09:24:40.321Z","lastUpdate":"2024-12-05T09:25:40.855Z","creatorRef":708988,"_id":"67517158aed1da6533d09f00"},{"text":"An update in 2020\n\nI originally published this blog post in mid-2018. It's 2 years later, and I thought I'd include some additional things I've learned in the interim.\n\nDon't overcommit yourself. I've found that the sweet spot for me is to prepare 1 conference talk a year, and maybe present it 2-4 times. I will never prepare multiple conference talks a year again, it takes too much time.\n\"Re-use\" content across multiple mediums. That conference talk you created would probably make an excellent blog post or tutorial! You've already done the work of researching and preparing and creating demos; there's more juice to be squeezed out of that orange!\nResearch the conferences before applying to them. Do they have a track record of shady practices? Are they doing work to ensure that the speaker lineup is diverse? In a very real way, the speakers represent the conference. Make sure it's an organization you feel comfortable representing.\nAside from those points, my overall viewpoint hasn't changed much. Conference talks are a ton of work, but they're also very rewarding. I'd encourage anybody who is interested in it to give it a shot!","note":"","color":"yellow","created":"2024-12-05T09:25:40.677Z","lastUpdate":"2024-12-05T09:25:40.855Z","creatorRef":708988,"_id":"675171941275de9bf8a937c3"}],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2024-12-05T08:50:18.748Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"lastUpdate":"2024-12-05T09:27:28.439Z","domain":"joshwcomeau.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":914740992,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":913282788,"link":"https://youtu.be/s2rqYu6jqWY","title":"Miriam Suzanne – Hints and Suggestions: The Design of Web Design – beyond tellerrand Berlin 2024","excerpt":"The web is fundamentally different from other platforms, built around a radical political vision for resilience, adaptability, and user control. With that vision under threat, the Cascade takes on an almost absurd task – styling unknown content, with unknown collaborators, on an infinite and unknowable canvas, across browsers, languages, writing modes, and device interfaces.\nThis is a dive into the origins of the web, and CSS in particular – the design constraints, the range of strange proposals, and how we got where we are. By the end, we have a better understanding of the cascade, and see the ‘CSS is Awesome’ meme in a new light.\n----About Miriam SuzanneMiriam is an author, artist, developer, and open web advocate.

First of all, the article by @joshkoor revolves around the central notion that bringing Progressive Enhancement (PE from now on) into our work is a burden on the modern web developer. You see, any site should be able to be rendered 100% in javascript, and that’s okay. Because the modern user has javascript, and expecting javascript to not be available is just plain pig-headedness.
