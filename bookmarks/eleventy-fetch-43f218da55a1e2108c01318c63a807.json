With that vision under threat, the Cascade takes on an almost absurd task – styling unknown content, with unknown collaborators, on an infinite and unknowable canvas, across browsers, languages, writing modes, and device interfaces.\nThis is a dive into the origins of the web, and CSS in particular – the design constraints, the range of strange proposals, and how we got where we are. By the end, we have a better understanding of the cascade, and see the ‘CSS is Awesome’ meme in a new light.\n----About Miriam SuzanneMiriam is an author, artist, developer, and open web advocate. She’s an Invited Expert with the W3C CSS Working Group, and member of the Sass core team, and a co-founder of OddBird – providing a range of web development and design services, along with in-depth web development workshops and trainings. Offline, Miriam spends her time repairing clocks, knitting socks, or creating hybrid performances with Teacup Gorilla & Grapefruit Lab.-----This presentation was given at the \"beyond tellerrand\" festival 2024 in Berlin.

I knew it was clickbait, but I clicked it and read it, because what else is a whiney SJW feminist fuck meant to do while she’s drinking her coffee in the morning? But then, as I scanned the page, I realised what deeper level of fucked-up-ness it represents. But let me back up and explain this. First of all, the article by @joshkoor revolves around the central notion that bringing Progressive Enhancement (PE from now on) into our work is a burden on the modern web developer. You see, any site should be able to be rendered 100% in javascript, and that’s okay. Because the modern user has javascript, and expecting javascript to not be available is just plain pig-headedness. Those whiny PE proponents are making a moral case for PE, rather than taking a utilitarian and path-of-least-resistance approach.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://awfulwoman.com/opengraph/card-base_hu17113780877341588093.png","media":[{"link":"https://awfulwoman.com/opengraph/card-base_hu17113780877341588093.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["Web Design","Building websites","HTML","A11y","JavaScript","Progressive enhancement"],"removed":false,"collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"created":"2024-11-29T23:05:58.093Z","lastUpdate":"2024-12-03T10:15:47.902Z","domain":"awfulwoman.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":911565911,"highlights":[],"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":900554746,"link":"https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2024/11/carving-space/","title":"Carving your space","excerpt":"Doing the work you love is hard when teams don't hire for it.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://heather-buchel.com/social-images/carving-your-space.png","media":[{"link":"https://heather-buchel.com/social-images/carving-your-space.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["Web Design","Working"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2024-11-15T01:02:23.483Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"lastUpdate":"2024-11-15T01:03:37.497Z","domain":"heather-buchel.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":900554746,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":851191309,"link":"https://ericwbailey.website/published/a11y-syntax-highlighting-has-been-updated/","title":"a11y-syntax-highlighting has been updated","excerpt":"Code syntax highlighting themes need to meet minimum color contrast values.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://ericwbailey.website/img/posts/a11y-syntax-highlighting-has-been-updated/share-image-facebook.png","media":[{"link":"https://ericwbailey.website/img/posts/a11y-syntax-highlighting-has-been-updated/share-image-facebook.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["CSS","A11y","Tools"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2024-09-10T01:32:03.964Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"lastUpdate":"2024-09-10T01:34:23.431Z","domain":"ericwbailey.website","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":851191309,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":847118521,"link":"https://adrianroselli.com/2024/09/semi-annual-reminder-to-learn-and-hire-for-web-standards.html","title":"Semi-Annual Reminder to Learn and Hire for Web Standards","excerpt":"Alex Russell wrote a four-part series a couple weeks ago arguing that modern JavaScript-first framework-focused front-end development is costing the industry and users.
