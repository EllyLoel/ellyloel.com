Mad Studies originated from consumer/survivor movements organized in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and in other parts of the world. The methods for inquiry draw from a number of academic disciplines such as women's studies, critical race studies, indigenous epistemologies, queer studies, psychological anthropology, and ethnography.&#91;1&#93; This field shares theoretical similarities to critical disability studies, psychopolitics,&#91;2&#93; and critical social theory. The academic movement formed, in part, as a response to recovery movements, which many mad studies scholars see as being \"co-opted\" by mental health systems.&#91;1&#93; In 2021 the first academic journal of Mad Studies, The International Journal of Mad Studies, was launched.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://rdl.ink/render/https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMad_studies","media":[],"tags":["Mad","Disability","Ableism"],"important":false,"reminder":{"date":null},"removed":false,"created":"2024-12-26T10:53:00.420Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"highlights":[{"text":"However, while the disability movement included Mad individuals, physical disabilities were centered, particularly in developing Disability Studies.[10] This becomes more apparent in the centering of impairment versus disability.
