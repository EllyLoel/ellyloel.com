This is not to say that every developer needs to have intimate knowledge of CSS when launching a personal project, but that major businesses need to invest in hiring front-end designers that specialize in this area. Many self-proclaimed full-stack developers don’t know how to write good and/or modern CSS. Hiring and promotion evaluations require developers to show deep skill in a variety of languages, but CSS is not often included. For many engineering teams, design is just a flourish, and a developer with rudimentary skill in CSS is good enough as long as they can tack on a framework that takes care of most of the heavy lifting. That heavy lifting, unfortunately, doesn’t account for the human time and care needed for things like accessibility.

Quite the contrary, I’d argue that all programming is feminine as it was pioneered by women (who were then pushed out by men). And while the web development community is still very much governed by men, a larger portion of the top voices in the front-end space are more feminine-identifying than in other areas. Consequently, these same voices are the ones that are brigaded with hate after daring to disagree with dominant ideas.","note":"","color":"yellow","created":"2023-07-10T23:30:05.433Z","lastUpdate":"2023-07-10T23:30:05.635Z","creatorRef":708988,"_id":"64ac947dd48eac706895befa"}],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2023-07-10T23:27:56.262Z","lastUpdate":"2023-07-10T23:30:05.635Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"domain":"thoughtbot.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":604176438,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":604175719,"link":"https://medium.com/@Heydon/reluctant-gatekeeping-the-problem-with-full-stack-e9ad836570f6","title":"Reluctant Gatekeeping: The Problem With Full Stack","excerpt":"Much of my career as a web designer has been spent, quite happily, working alongside programmers, engineers, people with computer science…","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://rdl.ink/render/https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40Heydon%2Freluctant-gatekeeping-the-problem-with-full-stack-e9ad836570f6","media":[{"type":"image","link":"https://rdl.ink/render/https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40Heydon%2Freluctant-gatekeeping-the-problem-with-full-stack-e9ad836570f6","screenshot":true}],"tags":["Building websites","CSS","HTML","JavaScript"],"highlights":[{"text":"We need to identify exploitation.

How can you tell? What does that mean? Where would you even start?\n\nI’d been making websites for over 20 years, and I didn’t understand what it was like to use the web with a cognitive disability until I developed one. After treatment to remove a slow-growing brain tumor, I had a hard time using most websites, including the ones I built! This real-world experience gave me a newfound perspective on accessibility, and I learned that there’s no better way to understand a user’s experience than living it. It also motivated me to learn new techniques that provide more accessible experiences for users with cognitive impairments and redesign parts of my sites with a focus on cognitive ease.\n\nThis session was in the Design Track.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nAlyssa Panetta has been designing and developing websites by hand since Y2K. She has worked for educational mathematics software companies and is currently a Web Designer/Developer for the University Libraries, University at Albany. After a diagnosis of brain cancer in 2020 and subsequent treatment, Alyssa started a website where she writes letters to her removed tumor that is preserved in a tumor research bank: deartalula.com.\n\nLearn more about axe-con at https://www.deque.com/axe-con/","note":"","type":"video","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lBe4WFqNW40/maxresdefault.jpg","media":[{"link":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lBe4WFqNW40/maxresdefault.jpg","type":"image"}],"tags":["A11y"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2023-06-28T11:15:00.301Z","lastUpdate":"2023-06-28T11:15:00.301Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"domain":"youtube.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":597983166,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":597643577,"link":"https://tetralogical.com/blog/2023/06/05/the-only-accessibility-specialist-in-the-room/","title":"The only accessibility specialist in the room - TetraLogical","excerpt":"Accessibility consultancy with a focus on inclusion.
