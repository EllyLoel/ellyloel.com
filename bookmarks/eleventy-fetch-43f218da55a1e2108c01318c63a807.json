Mad Studies originated from consumer/survivor movements organized in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and in other parts of the world. The methods for inquiry draw from a number of academic disciplines such as women's studies, critical race studies, indigenous epistemologies, queer studies, psychological anthropology, and ethnography.&#91;1&#93; This field shares theoretical similarities to critical disability studies, psychopolitics,&#91;2&#93; and critical social theory.

For my React Europe 2018 talk, I estimate that I spent over 150 hours on the talk; it consumed my mornings and weekends for a couple months.\n\nAssuming you make the median US software engineering salary of $104,000 a year, and put 150 hours of work into the talk, you’ve spent $7500 worth of your time getting it ready.\n\nIn addition, preparing a talk is a bumpy ride. There’s a bunch of stress along the way, a bunch of nights and weekends where you really don’t feel like working on it but do anyway, moments of crisis where you think your talk won’t work or isn’t interesting.\n\nFor all of that, conference talks tend to reach a surprisingly small audience. Most conference talks will be seen by a few hundred people live, and maybe another 1000 through the recording. Most of my blog posts get more views than that, and they take way less time to produce.\n\nSo on its face, the math doesn’t look favourable. Why spend so much time and energy on a conference presentation?\n\nIn my opinion, there are a few things that balance the scales:\n\nWhile relatively few people will see a conference talk, it can be a very impactful way to deliver a message. A well-crafted talk can inspire and motivate someone far more effectively than a tweet or blog post! For example, CodeSandbox(opens in new tab) was created by Ives Van Hoorne(opens in new tab) after attending React Europe, and he credits(opens in new tab) the conference with making him determined to build it!\nYou get to hang out with the other speakers. In many cases, these are the authors of the tools you use every day, or people whose work has inspired you for years.\nIt’s a tremendous way to make new friends who share your interests. After a conference talk, expect tons of folks to come up and ask pertinent follow-ups, or share some of the interesting things they’ve been doing.\nSpeaking at a conference makes people think that you’re a Real Expert™. It lends authority to what you’re saying. It can help you in your career for years to come.\nIt’s an experience. It’s a memory that you’ll have for the rest of your life, a Youtube video you’ll be able to watch when you're older. It’s a heck of a thing!","note":"","color":"yellow","created":"2024-12-05T09:24:40.321Z","lastUpdate":"2024-12-05T09:25:40.855Z","creatorRef":708988,"_id":"67517158aed1da6533d09f00"},{"text":"An update in 2020\n\nI originally published this blog post in mid-2018. It's 2 years later, and I thought I'd include some additional things I've learned in the interim.\n\nDon't overcommit yourself. I've found that the sweet spot for me is to prepare 1 conference talk a year, and maybe present it 2-4 times. I will never prepare multiple conference talks a year again, it takes too much time.\n\"Re-use\" content across multiple mediums. That conference talk you created would probably make an excellent blog post or tutorial! You've already done the work of researching and preparing and creating demos; there's more juice to be squeezed out of that orange!\nResearch the conferences before applying to them. Do they have a track record of shady practices? Are they doing work to ensure that the speaker lineup is diverse? In a very real way, the speakers represent the conference. Make sure it's an organization you feel comfortable representing.\nAside from those points, my overall viewpoint hasn't changed much. Conference talks are a ton of work, but they're also very rewarding.

By the end, we have a better understanding of the cascade, and see the ‘CSS is Awesome’ meme in a new light.\n----About Miriam SuzanneMiriam is an author, artist, developer, and open web advocate. She’s an Invited Expert with the W3C CSS Working Group, and member of the Sass core team, and a co-founder of OddBird – providing a range of web development and design services, along with in-depth web development workshops and trainings. Offline, Miriam spends her time repairing clocks, knitting socks, or creating hybrid performances with Teacup Gorilla & Grapefruit Lab.-----This presentation was given at the \"beyond tellerrand\" festival 2024 in Berlin.

I knew it was clickbait, but I clicked it and read it, because what else is a whiney SJW feminist fuck meant to do while she’s drinking her coffee in the morning? But then, as I scanned the page, I realised what deeper level of fucked-up-ness it represents. But let me back up and explain this. First of all, the article by @joshkoor revolves around the central notion that bringing Progressive Enhancement (PE from now on) into our work is a burden on the modern web developer. You see, any site should be able to be rendered 100% in javascript, and that’s okay. Because the modern user has javascript, and expecting javascript to not be available is just plain pig-headedness. Those whiny PE proponents are making a moral case for PE, rather than taking a utilitarian and path-of-least-resistance approach.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://awfulwoman.com/opengraph/card-base_hu17113780877341588093.png","media":[{"link":"https://awfulwoman.com/opengraph/card-base_hu17113780877341588093.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["Web Design","Building websites","HTML","JavaScript","Progressive enhancement","Accessibility"],"removed":false,"collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"created":"2024-11-29T23:05:58.093Z","lastUpdate":"2024-12-23T06:28:58.408Z","domain":"awfulwoman.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":911565911,"highlights":[],"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":900554746,"link":"https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2024/11/carving-space/","title":"Carving your space","excerpt":"Doing the work you love is hard when teams don't hire for it.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://heather-buchel.com/social-images/carving-your-space.png","media":[{"link":"https://heather-buchel.com/social-images/carving-your-space.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["Web Design","Working"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2024-11-15T01:02:23.483Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"lastUpdate":"2024-11-15T01:03:37.497Z","domain":"heather-buchel.com","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":900554746,"collectionId":33237518},{"_id":851191309,"link":"https://ericwbailey.website/published/a11y-syntax-highlighting-has-been-updated/","title":"a11y-syntax-highlighting has been updated","excerpt":"Code syntax highlighting themes need to meet minimum color contrast values.","note":"","type":"article","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":708988},"cover":"https://ericwbailey.website/img/posts/a11y-syntax-highlighting-has-been-updated/share-image-facebook.png","media":[{"link":"https://ericwbailey.website/img/posts/a11y-syntax-highlighting-has-been-updated/share-image-facebook.png","type":"image"}],"tags":["CSS","Tools","Accessibility"],"highlights":[],"important":false,"removed":false,"created":"2024-09-10T01:32:03.964Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":33237518,"oid":33237518},"lastUpdate":"2024-12-23T06:28:58.408Z","domain":"ericwbailey.website","creatorRef":{"_id":708988,"avatar":"https://up.raindrop.io/user/avatars/708/988/pfp.jpg","name":"ellyloel","email":""},"sort":851191309,"collectionId":33237518}],"count":352,"collectionId":33237518}
