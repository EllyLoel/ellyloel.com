			"excerpt": "I rolled my eyes when I saw this post circulate around the webosphere. I knew it was clickbait, but I clicked it and read it, because what else is a whiney SJW feminist fuck meant to do while she’s drinking her coffee in the morning? But then, as I scanned the page, I realised what deeper level of fucked-up-ness it represents. But let me back up and explain this. First of all, the article by @joshkoor revolves around the central notion that bringing Progressive Enhancement (PE from now on) into our work is a burden on the modern web developer. You see, any site should be able to be rendered 100% in javascript, and that’s okay. Because the modern user has javascript, and expecting javascript to not be available is just plain pig-headedness. Those whiny PE proponents are making a moral case for PE, rather than taking a utilitarian and path-of-least-resistance approach.",

			"note": null,
			"excerpt": "The big drawback to refreshable braille devices has always been their cost. The loose rule of estimation applied to these products has translated into something like $100 to $150 per braille cell. A 40-cell display, in other words, may cost $4,000 to $6,000, while an 80-cell model will cost $8,000 to $12,000. And so it has been that, while desirable, braille computer access has been out of reach for many users of assistive technology.It is thus of great value to lower the cost of individual braille cells in order to manufacture Refreshable Braille Devices at a price that is affordable to the Visually Impared community.While commercially available braille displays use expensive piezo-electric actuated pins. This project employs an electromechanical system with off-the-shelf and easily manufacturable components, leveraging the accessibility of high-quality 3D Printers and micro-magnets to keep the cost low without compromising functionality.Support my work by buying me a coffee ☕: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vjvaradaSource & Design files:  https://hackaday.io/project/191181-electromechanical-refreshable-braille-module#HackadayPrize #hackadayprize #braille #assistivetechnology #assistivetech",

Then, they die. It doesn't have to be this way. Enshittification occurs when companies gobble each other up in an orgy of mergers and acquisitions, reducing the internet to \"five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four\" (credit to Tom Eastman!), which lets them endlessly tweak their back-ends to continue to shift value from users and business-customers to themselves. The government gets in on the act by banning tweaking by users - reverse-engineering, scraping, bots and other user-side self-help measures - leaving users helpless before the march of enshittification. We don't have to accept this! Disenshittifying the internet will require antitrust, limits on corporate tweaking - through privacy laws and other protections - and aggressive self-help measures from alternative app stores to ad blockers and beyond!",

But our design tools aren’t yet equipped to allow designers to move easily from design to code. Where are the tools that allow for truly fluid layouts? What would they even look like?\n\nIn this talk, Jason will look at how our design processes have changed, how design tools should integrate with design systems, and how close we can get to an ideal fluid design tool today.",

				"The important bit is that they hinder deep learning of CSS. This is not to say that every developer needs to have intimate knowledge of CSS when launching a personal project, but that major businesses need to invest in hiring front-end designers that specialize in this area. Many self-proclaimed full-stack developers don’t know how to write good and/or modern CSS. Hiring and promotion evaluations require developers to show deep skill in a variety of languages, but CSS is not often included. For many engineering teams, design is just a flourish, and a developer with rudimentary skill in CSS is good enough as long as they can tack on a framework that takes care of most of the heavy lifting. That heavy lifting, unfortunately, doesn’t account for the human time and care needed for things like accessibility. The joke for many designers is that it’s incredibly easy to see what kind of site uses something like Bootstrap because no effort was put into customizing it.",
				"There are surely plenty of people of marginalized gender experience in all programming spaces, but they don’t have as much opportunity to surface new ideas. CSS is only allowed some slight breathing room simply because other programmers don’t even consider it to be part of web development. The distinction is even clearer when you consider the differences between front-end and backend salaries. CSS having any validity in the field while maintaining its feminine image is a threat to the notion that programming is a masculine exercise.",
				"CSS being a feminine language isn’t a bad thing. Quite the contrary, I’d argue that all programming is feminine as it was pioneered by women (who were then pushed out by men). And while the web development community is still very much governed by men, a larger portion of the top voices in the front-end space are more feminine-identifying than in other areas. Consequently, these same voices are the ones that are brigaded with hate after daring to disagree with dominant ideas."

While there are some gleeful Full Stack Developers, many are computer scientists given too many responsibilities, and over things for which they are not willing or qualified to be held accountable.We need to address the undervaluing of HTML and CSS for what it is: gender bias. Even though we wouldn’t have computer science without pioneering women, interloping men have claimed it for themselves. Anything less than ‘real programming’ is now considered trivial, silly, artsy, female. That attitude needs to eat a poisoned ass.We need to revisit the separation of concerns principle. We simply can’t afford for people to have to know everything just to do something. It’s good that we conceptualize designs in terms of self-contained components now, but that can be a mental model without being a technology-specific land-grab.Most of all, we need to educate people who don’t code at all just how many different things different types of code can do, and how different each is to understand and write. Hopefully, this way, more of us will be writing the kind of code that suits us best, and not spending our time anxious and demoralized because we don’t know what we’re doing, or we simply have too much on our plate. That’s not to say that if you do take to JS, CSS, HTML, SQL, and C# you shouldn’t be writing all of them if you‘d like to and you have enough time!"

Where would you even start?\n\nI’d been making websites for over 20 years, and I didn’t understand what it was like to use the web with a cognitive disability until I developed one. After treatment to remove a slow-growing brain tumor, I had a hard time using most websites, including the ones I built! This real-world experience gave me a newfound perspective on accessibility, and I learned that there’s no better way to understand a user’s experience than living it. It also motivated me to learn new techniques that provide more accessible experiences for users with cognitive impairments and redesign parts of my sites with a focus on cognitive ease.\n\nThis session was in the Design Track.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nAlyssa Panetta has been designing and developing websites by hand since Y2K. She has worked for educational mathematics software companies and is currently a Web Designer/Developer for the University Libraries, University at Albany.

Basing these decisions on the latest rounds of feedback further reduces risk.During Develop/Deliver stages, both design and functionality emerge side by side, informing one another. In this way, designers avoid specifying needlessly expensive directions or components or designing things in detail that don’t have value or won't be built. Engineers avoid building functionality ahead of validated business needs, and also avoid unnecessary rework due to unexpected redesigns.",

Traditional project handoff precludes the possibility of continuous listening, while the No Handoff Method is built around it.Designers are working directly on the product design, not on throwaway artifacts.Onboarding is happening continuously with end users during frequent testing phases. This further reduces the risk of users (or other stakeholders) unexpectedly rejecting the end results.Iteration and frequent user testing can give Marketing and Sales teams invaluable insights in advance of releases.An atmosphere of trust is built as developers and designers become comfortable openly sharing work earlier in the ideation phase without fear of reprisal for mistakes or imperfections.Leadership and end-users trust that they are being heard, too, because they see and experience the results of their feedback in future iterations.Trust allows teams to develop a culture of learning, continuously improving the product."

				"In Ettie Bailey-King’s article “Disability is not a dirty word“, she reminds us that it’s okay to say the word “disability” because disabled peoples’ lives aren’t tragedies. There’s nothing to sugar-coat with euphemisms like “special needs.”",
				"People are disabled by structures. A wheelchair user is disabled by design choices, like buildings without ramps.\n\n\n\nThe problem is social systems, not people’s bodies.\n\n\n\nDisability is a mismatch between a person and the environment they’re in.",
				"Disability is a spectrum and may be permanent, temporary or situational:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Microsoft Inclusive design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisability is the largest minority group there is and it’s the only one that we can enter at any time.",
				"Disability is not a monolith and there is no singular disabled experience. Some areas of intersectionality with disability include:\n\n\n\n\nRace\n\n\n\nGender identity\n\n\n\nSexual orientation\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\n\nSocioeconomic status\n\n\n\n\nThe experiences of a Black disabled person will vary from those of a trans disabled person or a poor disabled person in meaningful ways. Disability also intersects with every aspect of someone’s life:\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\nSchool\n\n\n\nFamily\n\n\n\nCommunity\n\n\n\nMass incarceration",
				"aid accessibility efforts, we can incorporate inclusive design. Inclusive design principals seek to create solutions that are usable by a wide range of people. There’s a saying in the disability community: Nothing about us without us. This means that our design process must include disabled people. We need to hire disabled people to create and build solutions. We need to pay disabled people for their feedback on how our solutions can work better for them.",

In fact, I am very skeptical of AI myself, despite my role at Microsoft being that of an Accessibility Innovation Strategist helping run the AI for Accessibility grant program. As with any tool, AI can be used in very constructive, inclusive, and accessible ways and it can used in destructive, exclusive, and harmful ones. And there are a ton of uses somewhere in the mediocre middle as well.  I’d like you to consider this a “yes… and” piece to compliment Joe’s post. I don’t seek to refute any of what he’s saying, but rather provide some visibility to projects and opportunities where AI can make a meaningful difference for people with disabilities (PwD) across the globe. To be clear, I am not saying there aren’t real risks and pressing issues with AI that need to be addressed—there are, and we needed to address them like yesterday—but I want to take a little time to talk about what’s possible, in hopes we’ll get there one day.",

If there is a tonne, I would avoid being exhaustive or overly detailed. I try to limit my auditing sessions to a fixed amount of time so that it doesn’t turn into an endless task or wear on me mentally. In situations where there’s a lot, I think it’s more important to call that out, but then focus on the high impact issues. Those will help a client get a sense of where to start and the resources they’ll need for it (which might include followup audits). Also, remember: you didn’t make this mess and you don’t need to burn yourself out to fix it.",

			"excerpt": "The websites we make are nothing less than multi-dimensional objects: the size and shape of them change with every device and browser they are viewed on. We have lots of new tooling to develop layouts for this multi-dimensional landscape, but one crucial element seems to have resisted our attempts at tooling: our typography. How does our typography both maintain meaningful structure while flexing across our dynamic website space? In this talk, we’ll explore that problem. We will make a map of how text and typography behave in our website landscape, and then take these maps and apply them using CSS animations. In this way, we’ll drive dynamic interpolations across our websites' multiple dimensions.\n\n----- \n\nAbout Scott Kellum\n\nScott Kellum is the founder of Typetura, a typography as a service company offering both bespoke and ready-made typographic solutions. With over 15 years of design experience across type, editorial, digital, and print design; Scott’s experience gives him a unique perspective on the typographic challenges and opportunities in the design industry. He has invented multiple web technologies, holds two patents, and has contributed to major projects at Vox Media, Darden Studio, and Roger Black Studio. These accomplishments include inventing dynamic typographic systems, high impact ad formats, new parallax techniques, and the fluid typesetting technology that powers Typetura itself.\n\n-----\n\nThis talk was held at the \"beyond tellerrand\" conference 2023 in Düsseldorf: More information about beyond tellerrand (#btconf in short) here: https://beyondtellerrand.com\n\nbeyond tellerrand is the affordable single-track event where creativity and technology meet in a renowned, familiar and friendly atmosphere.\n\nMastodon: https://mastodon.social/@btconf\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3808125/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/btconf\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/btconf",

			"excerpt": "(Split screen, with slides on the left, starting at 3:37)\n\nRemember Geocities? The unbridled creativity and questionable colour schemes of a bygone era. There was a time when websites existed as reflections of your personality or a shrine to your favourite band rather than carbon copies of a Facebook page or Twitter feed. Content wasn’t algorithmically curated, but shared through links pages and webrings.\n\nWith modern browsers, we have at our fingertips so many powerful APIs and tools to build the most incredible, beautiful and wonderfully pointless websites that have ever existed, in ways that are accessible and performant like never before. So why aren’t we? Why do all the websites today look the same?\n\nThis is a manifesto for building something just for the fun of it, and a rallying cry to tell your story on a platform that’s entirely yours.\n\n----- \n\nAbout Sophie Koonin\n\nSophie is the web engineering lead at Monzo Bank in London, responsible for the web platform across the organisation and working on internal tooling that powers Monzo’s award-winning customer service. Building websites since the age of 10, she’s passionate about creating inclusive, accessible and fun websites that people love.

				"There are many benefits of choosing a formal name for your design system:\n\n\n\n\nA helpful shorthand – A design system’s name is its brand name, and that name becomes a shorthand that encapsulates and embodies what the whole effort is about.\n\n\n\nMitigates confusion – many organizations have different permutations and generations of design systems floating around. Having a name that is distinct from “our company’s design system” can really helps clarify things. A design system called Splat allows people to say “Splat’s design tokens”,  “Splat’s accordion”, and so on.\n\n\n\nCreates a global namespace – Having a distinct global namespace for a design system is really important: it prevents collisions with non-design system code, creates a useful web component namespace, unlocks the ability to measure adoption, and more. So if the name is Splat, you could define splat-card, splat-button, splat-accordion and so on in CSS and code.\n\n\n\nHelps with marketing efforts – a brand name for the design system helps disseminate it around the organization. It can be helpful, exciting, and fun to have a real product name floating around. We’ve had clients create Christmas ornaments, t-shirts, mugs, and other swag."

				"Way back in the early oughts (actually, 1999–2000) I wrote a CMS (Content Management System) based on delimited text files. It was a lark. I wanted to teach myself some programming skills and my brother needed a mini-CMS while he was overseas.\n\n\n\nI quickly ran into the heading issue that HTML5 tried to solve — sometimes his content would be re-used elsewhere in the layout, and the headings would not make sense anymore. But I solved it. I solved it without any fancy frameworks or libraries or HTML5 retooling.\n\n\n\nEvery content container carried a variable (this was all server-side code). That variable was a number reflecting its nesting level on the page. That number was then used to replace the number in any <h#> levels in the content (the content was chunked enough that there was not more than one heading).\n\n\n\nI carried that technique forward into projects on much beefier CMSes and never had to worry about training authors how to manage chunked content on their home pages (and similar chunked pages). The move to HTML5 never made me consider an all-<h1> solution, partly because I knew the outline was not supported.",

Brad points out stale documentation as the primary pitfall for design system teams: \"They treat [design systems] as this off-to-the-side thing… Chores suck, so teams eventually stop updating reference documentation. Once the documentation ceases to reflect the reality of the product, the effort is dead in the water.\"If you could auto-generate documentation from code, that would ensure the production UI and docs stay in sync. When you build components in Storybook, you naturally capture all their use cases as stories. Those stories can also be used to auto-generate interactive API documentation. What’s more, you can add more context by writing Markdown or embedding design assets."

I talked to her about how I felt in the present day (afraid, tired, hungry, tired, angry), and she helped me draw links between those feelings and what happened when I was small.Then she encouraged me to talk to that little girl.Like, to have an actual conversation.“That’s stupid,” I said, pretending to be a rational person who’s not in constant dialogue with her cat.“Try it,” she said. “What would you tell yourself?”I tried it. From my therapist’s couch I found, in my memory, a small blond child alone on a schoolyard swing. She had been booted from class to “calm down”, so she was twisting up the chains and then letting go so they would spin her around. The air was cool. Autumn. Through the window, she could see other kids painting bright colours on to butchers paper.I imagined myself sitting next to her on the other swing. Why are you out here? I would ask, and she would say, I’m naughty, and the chains would clang as they unravelled.But what if, I would say, I knew you were trying your best?No one had ever said this to six-year-old Anna. They had only ever told her to be something different. I felt something click in my chest.After I had used up all my therapist’s tissues and gone home, I kept visiting this past self. I found her in classrooms where everything seemed too noisy. I found her hiding under the bed from people who would yell at her, panicking about report cards, forgetting her homework. I found her yelling, crying, laughing, wishing she could be somebody else. This anxious, bound-up kid fighting every single thing in her life."

				"Here's an overview of the landmark elements in HTML, their ARIA role and what they mean:aside (role: complementary) can be used to show content that is complementary to the main subject of the page. For example, links to related documents or meta info related to the main subject.footer (role: contentinfo) is where you put all the information about a page. Typically that's things like copyright info, related links, the authorform (role: form) can be a landmark element if it has a accessible name (set with aria-label, aria-labelledby or title attributes)header (role: banner) is where your page's \"introduction\" goes. Things like your logo, search and main navigation all go in here.main (role: main) contains the main content or functionality of your page.nav (role: navigation) is where you provide navigational links. They can be for your entire website (think your main menu), but also for your current page (think table of contents).section (role: region) This is a \"generic standalone section of a page\". Essentially, if you have a part of the page that stands alone, try to go down this list and if none of them fit but it's still a separate part of the page, use a section. Like forms, it'll only be a landmark if it also has an accessible name.There is still one more landmark that we need to discuss: the search landmark. All the landmarks above are HTML elements with a specific landmark role, but the search landmark role has no associated HTML element. It only exists in ARIA. As you might guess, the search landmark is used to indicate search functionality and practically, you'd add a search role to a form element to change it from a generic form to a search form."
