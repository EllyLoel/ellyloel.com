We might have done a lot but we haven’t actually gotten anything we wanted/needed done.

1. Divide a piece of paper up into boxes, one for each room.
2. Then list everything that needs to be done in each room.
3. Finally make copies of this, because you’re definitely going to be in this situation again and this will help you then!
4. Start in the room that overwhelms you the least
5. Take it one bit at a time
6. While cleaning, if you find a distraction place it aside to come back to once you’re done
