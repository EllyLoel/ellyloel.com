Understand What's Required
List all the steps

Order These Activities

Add in extra time
Always overestimate your time requirements 2x-3x
Estimate in Ranges
- multiply  & divide your estimate by 4, that gives you the lower-end and upper-end of your range.
Calculate Your Fudge Ratio
Create and refine your fudge ratio (actual time/estimated time)
Make your estimate when you're feeling tired or unmotivated

Track your confidence in the estimation and use that to get a better picture of what different levels of confidence indicate
