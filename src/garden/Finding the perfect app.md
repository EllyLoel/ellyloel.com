title: Finding the perfect app
---

I've tried just about every productivity app under the sun, and I still haven't found "the one".
Currently, I'm using ClickUp, but once again I'm thinking about switching ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I've put together a list of my criteria for the "perfect" app for my needs:
1.  Easily and quickly capture anything (task, note, link, etc.) from most devices (MacBook, iPhone, iPad, maybe even Apple Watch?)
2.  View all data (notes, tasks, etc.) in various ways/forms to improve clarity/understanding (mind map, list, table, graph, kanban, etc.)
3.  Centralise the data to view and work with in one place (either natively or through integrations)
4.  Find connections within the data either organically or through AI tagging/organisation
5.  Ability to be notified with due dates or reminders for tasks, events, etc.
6.  No confusion as to where data should be stored when trying to get stuff out of my mind into the app.
