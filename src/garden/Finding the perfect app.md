title: Finding the perfect app
---

I've tried just about every productivity app under the sun, and I still haven't found "the one".
Currently, I'm using ClickUp, but once again I'm thinking about switching 🤦🏼‍♀️

---

I've put together a list of my criteria for the "perfect" app for my needs:

1.  Easily and quickly capture anything (task, note, link, etc.) from most devices (MacBook, iPhone, iPad, maybe even Apple Watch?)
2.  View all data (notes, tasks, etc.) in various ways/forms to improve clarity/understanding (mind map, list, table, graph, kanban, etc.)
3.  Centralise the data to view and work with in one place (either natively or through integrations)
4.  Find connections within the data either organically or through AI tagging/organisation
5.  Ability to be notified with due dates or reminders for tasks, events, etc.
6.  No confusion as to where data should be stored when trying to get stuff out of my mind into the app.

## 1. Reference/File system

These are the processes and systems for storing both **_physical documents_** as well as **_digital documents and information_**.

### Solutions/approaches include:

- File Folders and File Cabinets for physical documents.
- Cloud-based storage (DropBox, Google Drive, etc.) for digital documents.
- Application-based storage (Evernote, Email Folders, OneNote, etc.) also for digital documents.

## 2. Project Management

A **_project_** is an activity that has a beginning and end, contains multiple steps, and performs something new or unique. A project will often involve multiple resources, costs, and require detailed tracking. Projects also have “**_dependencies_**”, which is where the start of certain steps is dependent upon the completion of prior steps.

### Solutions/approaches include:

- Project Management Applications (Microsoft Project, Trello, Asana, Wrike, Basecamp).
- Spreadsheet Tracking (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SmartSheets ).
- Written Project Plans with detailed Milestones (Microsoft Word, Google Docs).

## 3. Process Management

A **_process_** is a specific activity (or set of activities) performed repeatedly to achieve a desired result. It is critical that processes are clearly documented and consistently followed.

### Solutions/approaches include:

- Written Process Flows (Microsoft Word, Google Docs)
- Spreadsheet Tracking (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SmartSheets).
- Process Management applications (Asana, Trello, Basecamp, Tallyfy, KiSSFLOW, Workflowy)

## 4. Task Management

**_Tasks_** are discrete items that need to be prioritized and completed. They are what I like to call “**_one and done_**” activities. [Tasks can be a single, stand-alone item](http://www.emailoverloadsolutions.com/blog/microsoft-outlook-tasks-a-primer) that needs to be performed. Tasks are also often the result of "projects", which require completion of individual “tasks”.

### Solutions/approaches include:

- Manual Systems (Paper-based planners and check-lists).
- Spreadsheet Tracking (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SmartSheets).
- Dedicated Task Management Applications (ToDoist, Wunderlist, Rememberthemilk).
- Integrated Solutions (Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft OneNote, Google Apps, IBM Lotus Notes).

## 5. Schedule (Calendar) Management

A **_schedule_** (or "**_calendar_**") is for managing activities, tasks, and [meetings that occur at pre-defined, specific times](http://www.emailoverloadsolutions.com/blog/balancing-tasks-appointments).

### Solutions/approaches include:

- Manual Systems (Paper-based planners or calendars)
- Dedicated Calendar Applications (Google Calendar, Sunrise)
- Integrated Solutions (Microsoft Outlook, Google Apps, IBM Lotus Notes)

## 6. Communication Management

We all need to talk and **_communicate_**, but the key is to use [the right media for the right type of communication need](http://www.emailoverloadsolutions.com/blog/media-richness-theory-a-quick-primer).

### Solutions/approaches include:

- Email systems (Outlook, Gmail, etc.) for asynchronous written communications.
- Voice systems (telephone, teleconferences, cellphone) for real-time, voice communications that involve complex topics.
- Chat Systems (IM, text messages) for real-time simple communications.
- Video-Systems (Skype, Facetime) for real-time face-to-face communications that involve complex or sensitive topics.
- Face-to-face (office, coffee shop, meeting center) for face-to-face communications of a highly personal or sensitive nature.
