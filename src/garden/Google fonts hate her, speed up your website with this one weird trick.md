Jokes aside, I have spent a fair amount of time and effort figuring out how to improve my font situation.

Like many others, my "font setup" consisted of these three lines:
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:ital,opsz,wght,SOFT,WONK@0,9..144,100..900,0..100,0;0,9..144,100..900,0..100,1;1,9..144,100..900,0..100,0;1,9..144,100..900,0..100,1&family=Nanum+Pen+Script&family=Noto+Color+Emoji&family=Work+Sans:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap">
```

After far too long, I finally thought I ought to spend a bit more time and effort to turn my "font setup" into an actual font setup.
