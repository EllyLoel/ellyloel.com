title: Productivity system

## 1. Reference/File system
These are the processes and systems for storing both **_physical documents_** as well as **_digital documents and information_**.

### Solutions/approaches include:
- File Folders and File Cabinets for physical documents.
- Cloud-based storage (DropBox, Google Drive, etc.) for digital documents.
- Application-based storage (Evernote, Email Folders, OneNote, etc.) also for digital documents.

## 2. Project Management
A **_project_** is an activity that has a beginning and end, contains multiple steps, and performs something new or unique. A project will often involve multiple resources, costs, and require detailed tracking. Projects also have “**_dependencies_**”, which is where the start of certain steps is dependent upon the completion of prior steps.

### Solutions/approaches include:
- Project Management Applications (Microsoft Project, Trello, Asana, Wrike, Basecamp).
- Spreadsheet Tracking (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SmartSheets ).
- Written Project Plans with detailed Milestones (Microsoft Word, Google Docs).

## 3. Process Management
A **_process_** is a specific activity (or set of activities) performed repeatedly to achieve a desired result. It is critical that processes are clearly documented and consistently followed.

### Solutions/approaches include:
- Written Process Flows (Microsoft Word, Google Docs)
- Spreadsheet Tracking (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SmartSheets).
- Process Management applications (Asana, Trello, Basecamp, Tallyfy, KiSSFLOW, Workflowy)

## 4. Task Management
**_Tasks_** are discrete items that need to be prioritized and completed. They are what I like to call “**_one and done_**” activities. [Tasks can be a single, stand-alone item](http://www.emailoverloadsolutions.com/blog/microsoft-outlook-tasks-a-primer) that needs to be performed. Tasks are also often the result of "projects", which require completion of individual “tasks”.  
 
### Solutions/approaches include:
- Manual Systems (Paper-based planners and check-lists).
- Spreadsheet Tracking (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SmartSheets).
- Dedicated Task Management Applications (ToDoist, Wunderlist, Rememberthemilk).
- Integrated Solutions (Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft OneNote, Google Apps, IBM Lotus Notes).

## 5. Schedule (Calendar) Management
A **_schedule_** (or "**_calendar_**") is for managing activities, tasks, and [meetings that occur at pre-defined, specific times](http://www.emailoverloadsolutions.com/blog/balancing-tasks-appointments).

### Solutions/approaches include:
- Manual Systems (Paper-based planners or calendars)
- Dedicated Calendar Applications (Google Calendar, Sunrise)
- Integrated Solutions (Microsoft Outlook, Google Apps, IBM Lotus Notes)

## 6. Communication Management
We all need to talk and **_communicate_**, but the key is to use [the right media for the right type of communication need](http://www.emailoverloadsolutions.com/blog/media-richness-theory-a-quick-primer).

### Solutions/approaches include:
- Email systems (Outlook, Gmail, etc.) for asynchronous written communications.
- Voice systems (telephone, teleconferences, cellphone) for real-time, voice communications that involve complex topics.
- Chat Systems (IM, text messages) for real-time simple communications.
- Video-Systems (Skype, Facetime) for real-time face-to-face communications that involve complex or sensitive topics.
- Face-to-face (office, coffee shop, meeting center) for face-to-face communications of a highly personal or sensitive nature.
