# {{ title }}

Unable to focus in classes/meetings/conversations due to the lack of stimulation. We don't dislike you or find you boring we just require more stimuli to be able to stay focused.

Some examples:

- Playing games while chatting to friends
- Watching out the window while in class
- Listening to music while studying/working
- Fidgeting/stimming while in a meeting
