title: Sense of time
---

We don't experience time in the same way the [[neurotypical]] people do, we have no internal sense of the flow of time. That is why we're constantly in situations where we're late, whether it's for a deadline or an event.

---

The only two times that we comprehend are **now** and **not now**, and unfortunately even when things are now sometimes they're interpreted as not now.
