  I found the album art examples in the video to be especially interesting. As
  mentioned at the end of the video atype has its limits, never use out for text
  that is required to be read, but for extra embellishment/unrequired text it is
  great to not distract from everything else. When used in that way it could be
  considered an accessibility tool, so that people like my self with ADHD arenâ€™t
  as easily distracted by unrequired information.

  DESIGN INNOVATION 2024: a new era of fonts is upon us! Typography and
  abstraction became one. Please welcome, Atype.
