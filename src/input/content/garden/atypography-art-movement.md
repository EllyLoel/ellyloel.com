note: I found the album art examples in the video to be especially interesting. As mentioned at the end of the video atype has its limits, never use out for text that is required to be read, but for extra embellishment/unrequired text it is great to not distract from everything else. When used in that way it could be considered an accessibility tool, so that people like my self with ADHD arenâ€™t as easily distracted by unrequired information.
