excerpt: >-
  I recently saw it asserted that “if you don't have formal design training,
  you’re not a designer”. That’s a flawed statement because of the ubiquitous
  nature of design.

    design happens in a thousand little ways every day by non-designers. When
    folks choose the order of items on their restaurant menu, or make the
    newsletter for their community theater, or rearrange their living room to
    flow more naturally, they’re thinking about a system and enacting
    improvements to it. These are just people, though — they’re not necessarily
    academics nor are they necessarily not, but despite the lack of training in
    or even awareness of design thinking and discipline, they’re doing design.
