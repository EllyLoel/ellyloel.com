## Recording

You can check out the recording with this [free gift link for the recording on Conffab](https://conffab.com/presentation/view-transitions-in-the-real-world/?gl=Itwj2gUPDTjo). The recording also has closed captions and a transcript. There's no separate audio description track but I did my best to make sure I was describing everything as best I could during the talk.
