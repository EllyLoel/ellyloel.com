I've been thinking about how as boring as my current job is. 

And I'm remembering the thing that I always do, itâ€”boringnessâ€”is exactly what I need.

I need boring, slow paced, not overworked, not burnt out.

I've touched on this before in the second half of [What I want/need from a job](/what-i-want-need-from-a-job/).

And **god** do I hate this. Especially so in certain situations like:
The other day I got a message from [Nat](https://nataliethistime.com/) about this role at Kagiâ€¦

okok wipe the drool off your mouth and pick your jaw up off the floor.

This is literally almost perfect?! like genuinely i don't know when i'll see another role like this, feels like a once in a life time sighting lmao.

but I can't do it. I can't apply for it bc ik that I'll be so excited about the role that I'll throw my whole pussy into the job. I'll burn myself out in no time. *It's so fucking sad* ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

<!-- TODO: Reword or move or something to make this section work
I'd love to work at a company with an employee ownership model like Igalia or Bocoup working on standards, but I doubt that's gonna happen, at least not any time soon.

Also OddBird, ClearLeft, or CloudFour would all be awesome.

## Why you should slow down

This is so true and it's so incredibly fucked up. I'm working constantly to try and keep this front of mind so that I don't fall into these old habits of pushing myself too hard constantly.

> We liveÂ in aÂ worldÂ whereÂ hard workÂ isÂ rewardedÂ andÂ having needsÂ andÂ limitationsÂ isÂ seenÂ as aÂ sourceÂ ofÂ shame.Â It's no wonder so manyÂ ofÂ us are constantlyÂ overexerting ourselves, saying yes out of fear of howÂ we'll beÂ perceived forÂ saying no.

> The Laziness Lie is a deep-seated, culturally held belief system that leads many of us to believe the following:
>
> - Deep down I'm lazy and worthless.
> - I must work incredibly hard, all the time, to overcome my inner laziness.
> - My worth is earned through my productivity.
> - Work is the center of life.

> If there's one thing I learned throughout school and work, it's that you should never visibly operate at your peak even when urgency calls for it. This is because functioning at >=100% regularly, while possibly dazzling to your peers, managers, and spectators, is unsustainable and you'll only end up burning yourself out, especially when this becomes perceived as your operating baseline and expected of you to be your minimum capacity every work day.

## I think I'm eventually going to start my own thing

> 1. We share as much as we possibly can of the work we do and how we do it, resulting in us providing free â€” at the point of entry â€” real-world education material.
> 2. We focus our work on campaigns, movements and other efforts that bring tangible, progressive change to society.
