excerpt: >-
  It’s a typical Monday morning. You wake up, reach for your phone, and within
  seconds, you’re scrolling through an endless stream of updates.


  Your college roommate has a new puppy. Your aunt’s dog just died. Your
  coworker made homemade sourdough bread. Your second cousin just broke up with
  their partner. Very, very publicly.


  And before long, you’re adding to the noise. You’re posting about your early
  morning fog, your seasonal depression. That crushing existential dread. Etc.


  Without realising
