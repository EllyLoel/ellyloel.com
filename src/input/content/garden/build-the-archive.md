highlights:
  - I think my website should archive everything; every website I’ve ever made, every weirdo CSS demo, every little thing.
  - I want to earnestly look back on what I’ve made — the stuff that I think is cool and punk rock as well as the stuff that was half-baked, inexperienced, or headed in the wrong direction from the start.
