Read it if you want, though I'd recommend my essay [front-end development’s identity crisis](/garden/front-end-development-s-identity-crisis/) instead.

There really is a difference between being able to evaluate and implement designs and being able to build and connect functionality to the backend.
Specialising in a11y, i18n, CSS, etc. is a whole other ball game compared to hooking up interactive functions to APIs.

But I'm not a designer who knows how to code, I am a design engineer. My brain very much tends towards things like design systems, reusability, reducing repetition. Not to say I'm a crazy capitalist, who's after productivity at all costs, not at all. I just want to reduce or remove the menial work that we have to do, we are amazing creative creatures, so we shouldn't have to do that kind of work.

## Some great ways of thinking about it

> "A front-of-the-front-end developer determines the look and feel of a `button`, while a back-of-the-front-end developer determines what happens when that `button` is clicked."

— Brad Frost

> "A front-of-the-front-end developer is a web developer who specializes in writing HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code."
> "A back-of-the-front-end developer is a web developer who specializes in writing JavaScript code necessary to make a web application function properly."

— Brad Frost

The same separation applies to the backend:

> "A Front-of-the-backend person writes PHP/JS/etc. scripts which perform the required actions such as inserting records into a database, sending off an e-mail, etc."
> "A Back-of-the-backend person provisions and maintains the infrastructure."

— Bramus Van Damme
