highlights:
  - Purpose + Goals + Progress = Meaning
  - I hate what the culture of the web and the web industry have become.
  - The web has fallen prey to the fast fashion effect. Far too many people simply don’t care about the quality of what we make, as long as it just about works and brings in money today.
  - I imagine this is a lot like what artists feel like when they’re forced to make shitty little tourist trinkets to pay the bills because the really good stuff just doesn’t sell.
