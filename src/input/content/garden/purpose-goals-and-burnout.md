excerpt: >-
  Back in 2023, Amy Hupe gave a fantastic talk on meaning and burnout in the
  tech industry at the State of the Browser conference.

  Late last year, she gave a follow-up to to that same talk at FF Conf, and it’s
  even better than the original…
   In her talk, Amy digs into her own experiences with burnout, and emerging on the other side.
  For her, that involved getting more clarity on the purpose of her work, and
  how she derives meaning from it.

highlights:
  - Purpose + Goals + Progress = Meaning
  - I hate what the culture of the web and the web industry have become.

    The web has fallen prey to the fast fashion effect. Far too many people
    simply don’t care about the quality of what we make, as long as it just
    about works and brings in money today.

    I imagine this is a lot like what artists feel like when they’re forced to
    make shitty little tourist trinkets to pay the bills because the really good
    stuff just doesn’t sell.
