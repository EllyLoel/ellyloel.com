    Some people don’t pass because passing is bullshit and they know it’s good to be annoyingly visibly queer instead.

    I’m in the second camp: I have no intention of “passing” or hiding the fact that I’m trans, but I increasingly find myself tempted to do so, purely as a safety precaution.

    But no, I will never do that. I’d rather die than sacrifice being who I am.
