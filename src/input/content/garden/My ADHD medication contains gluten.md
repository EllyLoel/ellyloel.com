This means next to nothing for anyone else but, UGH!! WTF, like whyyyyy {% emoji "ðŸ« ", "melting face" %}

As I have Coeliac disease I can't eat anything containing gluten, so I'm going to have to start new medication {% emoji "ðŸ¥²", "smiling face with tear" %}

## Update!

I forgot about this note but today I stumbled upon it again. I come bearing good news!

I talked to my dietitian a while ago and it turns out there isn't enough gluten in it for it to actually be an issue, phew!
