excerpt: Large-language models aren’t just coming for our jobs, they’re coming for our thoughts and vibes.

highlights:
  - This feral, meteoric rise in popularity for LLMs and generative models is really due to an underlying, massively repressed cultural bedrock beneath a handful of people in the tech world. These dreamers believe in their bones that they should have already become billionaires, but simply never got the break they deserved. And no billionaire ever made billions off of their own labor. Being a billionaire is only possible by profiting off of someone else’s work. And LLMs offer to deliver this fantasy that so many petite capitalists have delusions about. LLMs are popular because of a wider cultural obsession with capitalistic vibes.
