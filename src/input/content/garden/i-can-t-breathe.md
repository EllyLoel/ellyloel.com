    Facebook memes taught me that, instead of facing my fear of needles, I could
    instead pretend I conscientiously object to vaccination programs, now my
    lungs are riddled with Covid and I can’t breathe.Sitting in my legally
    parked car eating a zinger burger was such an affront to the existence of an
    off-duty klansman that he put his boot on my neck and now I can’t breathe.I
    wiggled my little hedgehog nose into a plastic bag because vine fucking
    tomatoes have to be hermetically sealed for sale or a petrochemical heir
    won’t be able to afford his 17th Lamborghini and now I can’t breathe.My
    employer reclassified my job as a hobby and hobbies don’t come with sick pay
    or medical insurance, so now I’m living in a loophole, sat in an unheated
    flat cultivating pneumonia and I can’t breathe.A couple of breeders 100km
    upwind thought a pyrotechnic was the best way to communicate that their
    newly minted child comes with its own penis, now I’m chocking down burnt
    tree and I can’t breathe.I’m reading about all this chaos and misery and
    greed and sickness and it feels like it’s closing in around me, getting
    nearer every day and it feels like my throat is closing up and I can’t
    breathe.
