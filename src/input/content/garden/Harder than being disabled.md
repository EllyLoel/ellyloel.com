You know what's harder than being disabled, accepting that you're actually disabled.

You know what's harder than accepting that you're actually disabled, not holding yourself up to internalised ableist expectations.

Even though I know I can't do everything that non-disabled people can, I still can't help but expect that from myself.

I've spent my entire life not knowing that I was disabled and therefore not giving myself (or having others give me) adapted more suited expectations.
