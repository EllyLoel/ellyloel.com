~~~ callout **Content warning**
Future Elly here, I don't like how I worded this post. I wrote this in anger. The anger should've been solely directed at the ableist society we live in but due to my poor choice of words it can come across like I'm being dismissive of how hard being disabled can be. That isn't and wasn't ever my intention. Please keep that in mind while reading.

You know what's harder than being disabled, accepting that you're actually disabled.

You know what's harder than accepting that you're actually disabled, not holding yourself up to internalised ableist expectations.

Even though I know I can't do everything that non-disabled people can, I still can't help but expect that from myself.

I've spent my entire life not knowing that I was disabled and therefore not giving myself (or having others give me) adapted more suited expectations.
