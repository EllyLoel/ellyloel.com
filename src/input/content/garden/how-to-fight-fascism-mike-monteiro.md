excerpt: >-
  All design is political, because all politics are designed. The world is a
  mess because a certain set of people designed it to be a mess. Now we need a
  different set of people to design our way out of it. This is not a choice.
  Regardless of whether this is what we wanted or not fascism is knocking on our
  front door. This is how we knock back.
