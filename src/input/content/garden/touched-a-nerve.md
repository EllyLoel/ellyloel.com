note: I’ve been thinking about ‘care’ a lot lately. This pretty perfectly sums up the conclusions I’ve come to. People care that you care, they’re interested in that and they’re inspired by it. It’s so deeply human. Dear reader, please don’t stop caring, please tell me what you care about.
excerpt: I put a little care into something and sent it out into the world.
