it feels like the existence of the web is antithetical to capitalism

community based management and contribution and control of browsers would be ideal but that doesn't pay

it would be great if we didn't have to do thing based off of what pays, we should be able to do things that we care about

capitalism is antithetical to care

i don't think businesses should own browsers
i don't think governments should own browsers
i think the people should own browsers

issues with open source being unsustainable and users being too entitled 
that's a capitalism issue really
like yes labour is valuable but if we're in a non-capitalist system then things that benefit everyone but that doesn't make business sense become feasible 

everyone uses the internet 
5 billion people atm
this should not be a product 
this is public infrastructure like roads and railways and electricity and sewage and water, it's not meant to be profitable, it meant to be provided to everyone because it's a requirement for everyday life
especially poignant because the internet is international unlike most other public infrastructure, which is why it shouldn't be controlled by one government

subscriptions suck
even subscriptions for things I really care about supporting
they're only required because of capitalism
because caring about something isn't enough
we have to make it into a business so we can survive

## Capitalism's inherent conflict with the web

- It feels like the existence of the web is antithetical to capitalism.
- The profit-driven nature of capitalism forces projects—even those that many care about—to conform to financial imperatives.

- It would be great if we didn't have to do things based off of what pays, we should be able to do things that we care about.
- Capitalism is antithetical to care.
- I would love to be able to support the things I care about through non-monetary means, such as volunteering my skills, this is technically possible under capitalism but functionally who has the time or energy to volunteer on top of working a job.
- Even projects we're passionate about end up having to be monetised so we can survive.

- Subscriptions suck—even subscriptions for things I really care about supporting.
- It sucks that we as individuals—who're just trying to get by—have to foot the bill when corporations and governments have trillions.

## Ownership and control of browsers and digital infrastructure

- I don't think businesses should own browsers.
- I don't think governments should own browsers.
- I think the people should own browsers.
- Democratic control and community ownership over essential digital tools would be ideal but that doesn't pay. Again, this is a capitalism problem.

## Alternative economic and social models

- This is the same issue that we've been talking about for ages in regards to open source being unsustainable, it's a capitalism issue.
- Our labour is valuable. I don't hear that statement and think, "damn I should start a side hustle and work 100 hour weeks so I can become rich!". When I hear that I think, "wowee I sure do wish I could use my labour and specific skill set to benefit my community instead of working a job that I don't care about that doesn't pay me enough just so I can barely afford rent on my 2 bedroom shoebox apartment!"
- If we were in a post-capitalist system then things that benefit everyone but don't make business sense actually become feasible.

## The internet as public infrastructure

- Universal access is a human right
- Almost everyone uses the internet—5.5 billion people, 67%, two thirds (2/3) of the entire world.
- The internet should be viewed as a fundamental public utility rather than a commercial product.
- This is public infrastructure like roads and railways and electricity and sewage and water.
- Just as these essential services are provided for the common good, the internet should be accessible to everyone, regardless of its profitability.
- It's not meant to be profitable; it meant to be provided to everyone because it's a requirement for everyday life.

- I wonder if we can learn anything from trains, often privatised unprofitable public infrastructure
- \*looks at Melbourne and the UK\* oh no… please don't tell me we have to go through years of shit, only to end up with a weird not-fully-done half nationalisation system `<insert this is fine gif>`

- Especially poignant because the internet is international unlike most other public infrastructure, which is why it shouldn't be controlled by one government.
- The global nature of the internet argues against control by any single entity, whether a state or a private business.
