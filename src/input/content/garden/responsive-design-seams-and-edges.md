excerpt: In some ways, responsive design was an attempt to move past the idea of a “page.” How’s that worked out for us?

highlights:
  - 'as soon as a page is published online, we can’t predict how someone experiences it. Their screen might be wildly smaller or larger than mine, sure. But any number of factors might change the user’s experience: their network might be punishingly slow; their data plan could be stringently capped; they may use their voice to interact with my design; they may not see the screen like I do. In other words, we’ve never had any kind of control on the Web. And that lack of control can feel scary, sure — but if we approach it properly, it can be incredibly powerful.'
