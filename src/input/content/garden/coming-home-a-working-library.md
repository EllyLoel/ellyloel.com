highlights:
  - A website is, among other things, a container. The shape of that container both constrains and makes possible what goes within it. This is, I think, one of the primary justifications for having your own website. Not just so you can own your stuff (for some meaning of “ownership,” in a culture in which any billionaire can scrape your work without permission and copyright only protects the rich). Not just so you have a home base among the shifting winds of the various platforms, which rise and fall like brush before the fire. Not just so you can avoid setting up camp in a Nazi bar. But also so that you can shape the work—so that you can give shape to it, and in that shaping make possible work that couldn’t arise elsewhere.
  - Efficiency is an anti-goal; it is at odds with the work, which requires resistance and tension in order to come into being.
  - 'THIS IS, OBJECTIVELY, a difficult way to publish. There’s a great deal of friction between an idea or phrase coming to mind and the words making it out into the world. And I don’t mean the writing itself (which, as every writer will tell you, is dreadful), but the actual mechanics of sharing that writing. I mean, I am the fool who opens their damn terminal every time they want to publish; in recent weeks, I have spent a not insignificant number of hours writing some absolutely criminal CSS. I cannot, in good conscience, advise this path for anyone with sense. But the choice to do so suits my own proclivities: a desire to tinker not only with the words but with the strata underneath them, and a long-running interest in the material reality of publishing. And more often than not, I find that what I need is some friction, some labor, the effort to work things out.'
  - The great power of a middle-aged woman is that she knows where to give her fucks.
