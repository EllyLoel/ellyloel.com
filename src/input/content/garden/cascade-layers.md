## Coming up with a layer stack

My current layer setup:

```css
@layer reset, vars, base, blocks, utilities;
```

Miriam Suzanne shared this one in her CSS-Tricks article:

```css
@layer reset, default, themes, patterns, layouts, components, utilities;
```

And this one in her article "A Whole Cascade of Layers":

```css
@layer spec, browser, reset, default, features, layout, theme;
```

Though, as she mentions, `spec` and `browser` aren't actual layers she's creating, they're fundamental to the web.
So it's something more like this:

```css
@layer reset, default, features, layout, theme;
```

## Ways to create or put styles into layers

### Formal syntax

```css
@layer [ <layer-name># | <layer-name>? { <stylesheet> } ]
```

WTF does that mean though??

Okay, let's break it down

```css
@layer [
  /* 1 or more layer names */
  <layer-name>#
  /* OR */
  |
  /* 0 or 1 layer names with styles */
  <layer-name>? { <stylesheet> }
]
```

Basically, these are the ways you can use `@layer`:

```css
/* 1 layer name */
@layer layer-name;

/* More than 1 layer name */
@layer layer-name, layer-name, layer-name;

/* No layer name with styles */
@layer {
	.foo {
		baz: bar;
	}
}

/* 1 layer name with styles */
@layer layer-name {
	.foo {
		baz: bar;
	}
}
```

### But wait, there's more

Don't forget about importing styles into a layer

```css
@import "foo.css" layer(layer-name);
```

There's even been [talk](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5853) of being able to set a layer when linking to a stylesheet

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="foo.css" layer="layer-name" />
```
