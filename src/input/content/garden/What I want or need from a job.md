This post was inspired by Lynn Fisher's post [Unordered, incomplete list of things I want from a job](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/unordered-incomplete-list-of-things-i-want-from-a-job/) and my lovely former colleague Joanne Osbourne-Taylor. The dot points are based on the workplace attributes cards that were made by my wonderful friend Julia Birks.
I'm doing this because I need a place to direct others and a way to remind myself what I want/need from a job.

## Must have

- **Partially or fully remote** – I can work partially or fully remote to help manage my wellbeing.
- **Part time options** – I can work reduced hours (part time work) compressed hours.
- **Inclusive culture** – The workplace is pretty inclusive of people who are trans, queer, disabled, neurodivergent, etc.

## Should have

- **Well-organised workplace** – There is a level of structure within the organisation around tasks, policies, decision-making, and so on that aligns with my preferences.
- **Unionised role or industry** – The workplace or industry is unionised so I will have options for support if needed.
- **Supportive mentors** – I will have access to a mentor or leader who will support my growth and be at least somewhat available to teach me new things as I do my work.
- **Do work I enjoy** – The job requirements include enough tasks that are aligned with what I enjoy doing.
- **Organisation's values match my own** – The organisation's values align with my own values from a social, political, or emotional perspective.
- **Good leave entitlements** – I can access types of leave that will help me to manage my physical and mental wellbeing.

## Added bonus

- **Positively challenging** – I will be able to do work I find positively challenging, and will allow me to stretch myself and build new skills.
- **Good growth pathways** – There are established growth pathways I can pursue within or outside of my discipline or department that are of interest to me.
- **Development budget** – There is a development budget available to me so l can invest in my growth and get certifications and new workplace skills.
- **The pay is good** – The salary package (including any superannuation) will meet my needs.
- **Flexible hours** – The work can fit around my study, healthcare, or other scheduling needs.
- **Overtime options** – The role is aligned to my preference for overtime: I will not need to work overtime, there is minimal overtime, there is time-in-lieu, or I can work overtime for extra pay.
- **I like the people I work with** – The people I work with are a good social, cultural or values fit.
- **Work in an industry I like** – The industry the role sits within is one I find interesting, enjoyable or motivating.
- **Diverse work and tasks** – The tasks I do in the role will provide lots of opportunity to keep things interesting and stimulating intellectually or physically.
