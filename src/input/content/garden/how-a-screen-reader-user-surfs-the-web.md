excerpt: >-
  In this webinar you’ll learn how and why semantic HTML helps screen reader
  users browse your website, whilst being mostly transparent to people who do
  not use an Assistive Technology (AT). Join Léonie Watson,  a blind screen
  reader user, as she explores the web, and find out about some unexpected
  properties of HTML elements that not only have a huge impact on accessibility,
  but also turn out to be pretty good for performance too.
