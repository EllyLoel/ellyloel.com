    However, while the disability movement included Mad individuals, physical disabilities were centered, particularly in developing Disability Studies.[10] This becomes more apparent in the centering of impairment versus disability. According to Disabled Peoples' International, impairment refers to "the functional limitation within the individual caused by physical, mental or sensory impairment," where disability refers to "the loss or limitation of opportunities to take part in the normal life of the community on an equal level with others due to physical and social barriers."[11]: 5  People with mental health conditions may feel the language of impairment does not apply to their experience.

    Further, though lay individuals with mental health conditions may dislike the language of madness, they also do not feel the social model of disability adequately represents their needs and struggles.[12]
