excerpt: >-
  Mad studies is a field of scholarship, theory, and activism about the lived
  experiences, history, cultures, and politics about people who may identify as
  mad, mentally ill, psychiatric survivors, consumers, service users, patients,
  neurodivergent, and disabled. Mad Studies originated from consumer/survivor
  movements organized in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom,
  Australia, and in other parts of the world. The methods for inquiry draw from
  a number of academic disciplines such as women's studies, critical race
  studies, indigenous epistemologies, queer studies, psychological anthropology,
  and ethnography.&#91;1&#93; This field shares theoretical similarities to
  critical disability studies, psychopolitics,&#91;2&#93; and critical social
  theory. The academic movement formed, in part, as a response to recovery
  movements, which many mad studies scholars see as being "co-opted" by mental
  health systems.&#91;1&#93; In 2021 the first academic journal of Mad Studies,
  The International Journal of Mad Studies, was launched.

    However, while the disability movement included Mad individuals, physical
    disabilities were centered, particularly in developing Disability
    Studies.[10] This becomes more apparent in the centering of impairment
    versus disability. According to Disabled Peoples' International, impairment
    refers to "the functional limitation within the individual caused by
    physical, mental or sensory impairment," where disability refers to "the
    loss or limitation of opportunities to take part in the normal life of the
    community on an equal level with others due to physical and social
    barriers."[11]: 5  People with mental health conditions may feel the
    language of impairment does not apply to their experience.


    Further, though lay individuals with mental health conditions may dislike
    the language of madness, they also do not feel the social model of
    disability adequately represents their needs and struggles.[12]
