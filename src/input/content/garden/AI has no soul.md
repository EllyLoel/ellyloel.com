It was honestly really hard to decide on the title for this post. I could have gone with insolent, insipid, ignorant, insulting, insensitive, inconsiderate, irresponsible, idiotic, or even just plain icky.

I'm not going to list out and break down every critique of AI, you can find that else where (maybe in [The average AI criticism has gotten lazy, and that's dangerous](https://redeem-tomorrow.com/the-average-ai-criticism-has-gotten-lazy-and-thats-dangerous) by Danilo Campos[^1]).

[^1]: Though I don't love that article, for a number of reasons:
    - the use of the word "lazy", go read [this book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laziness_Does_Not_Exist)
    - the free pass given to energy consumption
    - the lack of distinction between AI, machine learning and LLMs. Like when he's talking about writing code, detecting cancer cells, and proofreading documents ðŸ™„

AI is good at prose, language, etc. but it isn't good at meaning.
It has nothing to say, so it doesn't say much. But it looks like it's saying lots.
We find use in AI because we're forced to do lots of writing that conforms to expectations of share but often contain little to no meaning.
AI is only useful because of the society we live in. We wouldn't have any use for it if we didn't have to do pencil pushing.
But we're stuck trying to make the line go up.
