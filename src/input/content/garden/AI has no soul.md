AI is good at prose, language, etc. but it isn't good at meaning.
It has nothing to say, so it doesn't say much. But it looks like it's saying lots.
We find use in AI because we're forced to do lots of writing that conforms to expectations of share but often contain little to no meaning.
AI is only useful because of the society we live in. We wouldn't have any use for it if we didn't have to do pencil pushing.
But we're stuck trying to make the line go up.
