excerpt: >-
  I rolled my eyes when I saw this post circulate around the webosphere. I knew
  it was clickbait, but I clicked it and read it, because what else is a whiney
  SJW feminist fuck meant to do while she’s drinking her coffee in the morning?
  But then, as I scanned the page, I realised what deeper level of
  fucked-up-ness it represents. But let me back up and explain this. First of
  all, the article by @joshkoor revolves around the central notion that bringing
  Progressive Enhancement (PE from now on) into our work is a burden on the
  modern web developer. You see, any site should be able to be rendered 100% in
  javascript, and that’s okay. Because the modern user has javascript, and
  expecting javascript to not be available is just plain pig-headedness. Those
  whiny PE proponents are making a moral case for PE, rather than taking a
  utilitarian and path-of-least-resistance approach.
