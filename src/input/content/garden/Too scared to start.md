I have so many ideas but I'm too scared to actually turn them into anything.

I'm scared of getting stuck.
I'm scared of being frustrated.
I'm scared of wasting time.
I'm scared of not being able to do it.
I'm scared of having to ask for help.
I'm scared of feeling like I should have spent my time on something else.
**I'm scared.**

I know I shouldn't be scared of those things.
I know that it's okay to get stuck.
I know that it's okay to be frustrated.
I know that it's okay to waste time.
I know that it's okay to not be able to do it.
I know that it's okay to ask for help.
I know that I don't have foresight, and I can't possibly know what future me wants current me to spend time on.
**I know.**

_But knowing doesn't seem to lessen my fears..._
