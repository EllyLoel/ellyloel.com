  In what I hope becomes a series, I've been recording myself as I drive home
  from dropping my daughter off at school. Shifting away from more heady topics
  like AI's impact on design and development, I felt like talking about the
  importance of choosing a name for your design system. Give it a listen:

    There are many benefits of choosing a formal name for your design system:





    A helpful shorthand – A design system’s name is its brand name, and that
    name becomes a shorthand that encapsulates and embodies what the whole
    effort is about.




    Mitigates confusion – many organizations have different permutations and
    generations of design systems floating around. Having a name that is
    distinct from “our company’s design system” can really helps clarify things.
    A design system called Splat allows people to say “Splat’s design tokens”, 
    “Splat’s accordion”, and so on.




    Creates a global namespace – Having a distinct global namespace for a design
    system is really important: it prevents collisions with non-design system
    code, creates a useful web component namespace, unlocks the ability to
    measure adoption, and more. So if the name is Splat, you could define
    splat-card, splat-button, splat-accordion and so on in CSS and code.




    Helps with marketing efforts – a brand name for the design system helps
    disseminate it around the organization. It can be helpful, exciting, and fun
    to have a real product name floating around. We’ve had clients create
    Christmas ornaments, t-shirts, mugs, and other swag.
