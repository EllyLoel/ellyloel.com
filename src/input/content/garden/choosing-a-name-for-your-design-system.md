    There are many benefits of choosing a formal name for your design system:




    A helpful shorthand – A design system’s name is its brand name, and that name becomes a shorthand that encapsulates and embodies what the whole effort is about.



    Mitigates confusion – many organizations have different permutations and generations of design systems floating around. Having a name that is distinct from “our company’s design system” can really helps clarify things. A design system called Splat allows people to say “Splat’s design tokens”,  “Splat’s accordion”, and so on.



    Creates a global namespace – Having a distinct global namespace for a design system is really important: it prevents collisions with non-design system code, creates a useful web component namespace, unlocks the ability to measure adoption, and more. So if the name is Splat, you could define splat-card, splat-button, splat-accordion and so on in CSS and code.



    Helps with marketing efforts – a brand name for the design system helps disseminate it around the organization. It can be helpful, exciting, and fun to have a real product name floating around. We’ve had clients create Christmas ornaments, t-shirts, mugs, and other swag.
