excerpt: >-
  The big drawback to refreshable braille devices has always been their cost.
  The loose rule of estimation applied to these products has translated into
  something like $100 to $150 per braille cell. A 40-cell display, in other
  words, may cost $4,000 to $6,000, while an 80-cell model will cost $8,000 to
  $12,000. And so it has been that, while desirable, braille computer access has
  been out of reach for many users of assistive technology.It is thus of great
  value to lower the cost of individual braille cells in order to manufacture
  Refreshable Braille Devices at a price that is affordable to the Visually
  Impared community.While commercially available braille displays use expensive
  piezo-electric actuated pins. This project employs an electromechanical system
  with off-the-shelf and easily manufacturable components, leveraging the
  accessibility of high-quality 3D Printers and micro-magnets to keep the cost
  low without compromising functionality.Support my work by buying me a coffee
