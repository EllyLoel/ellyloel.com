    I believe the root of the problem is using the name Design Token for
    experimental approaches while a group aims to define what it means to be a
    Design Token. These other formats do not follow the specification in small
    and large ways and are therefore not accurate in describing Design Tokens as
    we expect them to be used in the community universally. Rebranding these
    novel approaches as something else for future features (as Figma has done)
    would make the expectations and responsibilities of Design Tokens more
    understandable to the community moving forward.
