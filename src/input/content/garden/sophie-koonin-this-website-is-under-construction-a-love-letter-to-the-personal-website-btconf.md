  (Split screen, with slides on the left, starting at 3:37)


  Remember Geocities? The unbridled creativity and questionable colour schemes
  of a bygone era. There was a time when websites existed as reflections of your
  personality or a shrine to your favourite band rather than carbon copies of a
  Facebook page or Twitter feed. Content wasn’t algorithmically curated, but
  shared through links pages and webrings.


  With modern browsers, we have at our fingertips so many powerful APIs and
  tools to build the most incredible, beautiful and wonderfully pointless
  websites that have ever existed, in ways that are accessible and performant
  like never before. So why aren’t we? Why do all the websites today look the
  same?


  This is a manifesto for building something just for the fun of it, and a
  rallying cry to tell your story on a platform that’s entirely yours.
