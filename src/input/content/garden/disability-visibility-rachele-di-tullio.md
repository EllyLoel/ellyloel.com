    In Ettie Bailey-King’s article “Disability is not a dirty word“, she reminds
    us that it’s okay to say the word “disability” because disabled peoples’
    lives aren’t tragedies. There’s nothing to sugar-coat with euphemisms like
    “special needs.”
  - >-
    People are disabled by structures. A wheelchair user is disabled by design
    choices, like buildings without ramps.




    The problem is social systems, not people’s bodies.




    Disability is a mismatch between a person and the environment they’re in.
  - >-
    Disability is a spectrum and may be permanent, temporary or situational:






    From Microsoft Inclusive design












    Disability is the largest minority group there is and it’s the only one that
    we can enter at any time.
  - >-
    Disability is not a monolith and there is no singular disabled experience.
    Some areas of intersectionality with disability include:





    Race




    Gender identity




    Sexual orientation




    Size




    Socioeconomic status





    The experiences of a Black disabled person will vary from those of a trans
    disabled person or a poor disabled person in meaningful ways. Disability
    also intersects with every aspect of someone’s life:





    Employment




    School




    Family




    Community




    Mass incarceration

    aid accessibility efforts, we can incorporate inclusive design. Inclusive
    design principals seek to create solutions that are usable by a wide range
    of people. There’s a saying in the disability community: Nothing about us
    without us. This means that our design process must include disabled people.
    We need to hire disabled people to create and build solutions. We need to
    pay disabled people for their feedback on how our solutions can work better
    for them.
  - Disability is never a barrier. Design is.
