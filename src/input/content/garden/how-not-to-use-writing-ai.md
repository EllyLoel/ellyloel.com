  #ChatGPT #writingadvice

  Write a terrible sentence, click “show don’t tell”, and great prose comes out -- is this CHEATING? Programs like ChatGPT and SudoWrite can enable you to produce work above your writing skill level. You can write whole novels with these engines. How should writers contend with this new technology? On the one hand, it’s a tool that produces great results -- why not use it? On the other hand, you’re not getting better at writing -- that’s a problem, right? In my opinion there’s a way to use this productively for writers in certain situations. But at the same time, it should be approached with caution.
