  Growing up, Anna Spargo-Ryan was taught she was naughty and lazy. After an
  adult diagnosis of ADHD, she’s revisiting that kid – and together they’re
  rewriting history

    I’d been in therapy for decades, but I had a new psychologist helping with
    my anxiety who was teaching me about my young self. I talked to her about
    how I felt in the present day (afraid, tired, hungry, tired, angry), and she
    helped me draw links between those feelings and what happened when I was
    small.Then she encouraged me to talk to that little girl.Like, to have an
    actual conversation.“That’s stupid,” I said, pretending to be a rational
    person who’s not in constant dialogue with her cat.“Try it,” she said. “What
    would you tell yourself?”I tried it. From my therapist’s couch I found, in
    my memory, a small blond child alone on a schoolyard swing. She had been
    booted from class to “calm down”, so she was twisting up the chains and then
    letting go so they would spin her around. The air was cool. Autumn. Through
    the window, she could see other kids painting bright colours on to butchers
    paper.I imagined myself sitting next to her on the other swing. Why are you
    out here? I would ask, and she would say, I’m naughty, and the chains would
    clang as they unravelled.But what if, I would say, I knew you were trying
    your best?No one had ever said this to six-year-old Anna. They had only ever
    told her to be something different. I felt something click in my chest.After
    I had used up all my therapist’s tissues and gone home, I kept visiting this
    past self. I found her in classrooms where everything seemed too noisy. I
    found her hiding under the bed from people who would yell at her, panicking
    about report cards, forgetting her homework. I found her yelling, crying,
    laughing, wishing she could be somebody else. This anxious, bound-up kid
    fighting every single thing in her life.
