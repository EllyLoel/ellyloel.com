excerpt: |-
  My digital garden has an entire section with copy/paste code snippets and boilerplates.
  I use these nearly every day when writing code. It helps me start working faster, and saves me from having to rewrite the same code over-and-over again.
  I created web component boilerplate years ago. Since then, my approach to writing web component has changed quite a bit.
  I just updated the boilerplate, adding everything I’ve learned from working on Kelp UI.
