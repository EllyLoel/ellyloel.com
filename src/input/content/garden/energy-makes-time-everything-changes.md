    It turns out, not doing their art was costing them time, was draining it
    away, little by little, like a slow but steady leak. They had assumed,
    wrongly, that there wasn’t enough time in the day to do their art, because
    they assumed (because we’re conditioned to assume) that every thing we do
    costs time. But that math doesn’t take energy into account, doesn’t grok
    that doing things that energize you gives you time back. By doing their art,
    a whole lot of time suddenly returned. Their art didn’t need more time;
    their time needed their art.
