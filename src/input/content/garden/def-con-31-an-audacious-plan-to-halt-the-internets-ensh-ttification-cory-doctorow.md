excerpt: >-
  The enshittification of the internet follows a predictable trajectory: first,
  platforms are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things
  better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business
  customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die. It
  doesn't have to be this way. Enshittification occurs when companies gobble
  each other up in an orgy of mergers and acquisitions, reducing the internet to
  "five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four"
  (credit to Tom Eastman!), which lets them endlessly tweak their back-ends to
  continue to shift value from users and business-customers to themselves. The
  government gets in on the act by banning tweaking by users -
  reverse-engineering, scraping, bots and other user-side self-help measures -
  leaving users helpless before the march of enshittification. We don't have to
  accept this! Disenshittifying the internet will require antitrust, limits on
  corporate tweaking - through privacy laws and other protections - and
  aggressive self-help measures from alternative app stores to ad blockers and
  beyond!
