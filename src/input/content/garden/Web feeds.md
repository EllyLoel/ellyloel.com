I've noticed that I tend to think that [JSON Feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org/) is the "best". I'd say that's because it's newer and (I think) it has more features. But if I really think about it I prefer the HTML-ish-ness of [RSS](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) and [Atom](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4287.html). Especially when things like [XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/) come into the mix and your feed becomes a lovely looking web page! (~~That reminds me, I need to hurry up and style my feeds with XSLT~~ Good news, [I did it!](/feed.rss))

Interestingly [Apple Podcasts are now RSS2.0 only, no Atom](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/823-podcast-requirements). And, along similar lines Mark Nottingham says <q cite="https://www.mnot.net/rss/tutorial/">There isnâ€™t any reason to publish in both formats</q> in his [RSS and Atom Feed Tutorial](https://www.mnot.net/rss/tutorial/).

I think I'll continue to offer RSS, Atom and JSON. It may be futile, but idk I like it? They're all definitely better than email newsletters!
