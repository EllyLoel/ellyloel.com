I think I tend to think that [JSON Feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org/) is the best, but I'd say that's because it's newer and it has more features. If I really think about it I prefer the HTMLishness of [RSS](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) and [Atom](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4287.html). Especially when things like [XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/) come into the mix and your feed becomes a lovely looking web page! (That reminds me, I need to hurry up and style my feeds with XSLT)

Interestingly [Apple Podcasts are now RSS2.0 only, no Atom](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/823-podcast-requirements). And, along similar lines Mark Nottingham says <q cite="https://www.mnot.net/rss/tutorial/">There isnâ€™t any reason to publish in both formats</q> in his [RSS and Atom Feed Tutorial](https://www.mnot.net/rss/tutorial/).
