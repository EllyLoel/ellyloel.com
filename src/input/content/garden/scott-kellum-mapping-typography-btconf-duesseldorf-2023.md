excerpt: >-
  The websites we make are nothing less than multi-dimensional objects: the size
  and shape of them change with every device and browser they are viewed on. We
  have lots of new tooling to develop layouts for this multi-dimensional
  landscape, but one crucial element seems to have resisted our attempts at
  tooling: our typography. How does our typography both maintain meaningful
  structure while flexing across our dynamic website space? In this talk, we’ll
  explore that problem. We will make a map of how text and typography behave in
  our website landscape, and then take these maps and apply them using CSS
  animations. In this way, we’ll drive dynamic interpolations across our
  websites' multiple dimensions.
