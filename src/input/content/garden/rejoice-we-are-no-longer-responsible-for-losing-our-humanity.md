highlights:
  - “It helps me express myself” I’ve heard in response. But I just think, “you couldn’t sit still for long enough to come up with anything else? You can’t suffer the world around you and your own body long enough to conjure up something yourself?”
  - We would rather automate our dissociation than feel any reflexive relationship to our own bodies and the world around us.
