I've got some incredibly exciting news to share! Recently, I was extended an invitation by John Allsopp to present at [Web Directions Code](https://webdirections.org/code/). It's an incredible opportunity that stemmed from the recent blog post I wrote titled "[Front-end development’s identity crisis](https://www.ellyloel.com/blog/front-end-development-s-identity-crisis)." Little did I know, that post would resonate with so many amazing individuals, including John. The response was overwhelming, and thankfully it caught the attention of the right people.

So, I'm now gearing up to deliver [my talk at Web Directions Code](https://webdirections.org/code/speakers/elly-loel.php). It's an amazing opportunity to share the ideas covered in the post with a wider audience. As well as a chance to delve deeper into the issues surrounding front-end development and the web industry more broadly. On top of that, there is going to be an absolutely [amazing lineup of speakers](https://webdirections.org/code/index.php#speakers) with a broad range of interesting topics.

If this sounds exciting to you, mark your calendars! Web Directions Code will be held at [ACMI in Federation Square, Melbourne](https://www.acmi.net.au) on June 20 and 21. If you're wanting to join me, you can use [my special promo code `ellycode24`](https://webdirections.org/register/?eventName=code24&eventTitle=Code%2024&selectedTicket=code24gold&promoCode=ellycode24) to receive $200 off your in-person ticket. If you can't or don't want to be there in-person the event will also be available online both live and on demand.

I'm incredibly grateful for this opportunity and humbled by the support that has propelled me to this point. It's a reminder of how powerful sharing our thoughts can be, something that's often easy to forget. I'm really looking forward to it and I hope to see some friendly faces there!
