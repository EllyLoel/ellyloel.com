    The questions I wished I had asked myself back then are: What are the risks
    of making a change? What are the risks of not doing so? How might you
    mitigate those risks? Whatâ€™s a small, experimental step you can take, right
    now? Not tomorrow or next week, but this hour, this minute?

    And: how do you want to be in your work? This is different from what you
    want to do. How do you want to show up, to be present, to experience the
    work? What needs to change (in you, or in your environment) for that to be
    possible?
