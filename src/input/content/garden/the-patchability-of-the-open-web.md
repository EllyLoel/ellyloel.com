highlights:
  - I under-appreciate the ability to patch or coerce websites to meet my needs. That’s a feature of HTML, written in the by-laws as “consider users over authors”. As a user, I get the final say. This is why stylesheets cascade, why JavaScript can be turned off, and why browser extensions exist; it’s a foundational aspect of the web.
