excerpt: >-
  After all the WCAG standards are met, how accessible is your site for users
  with cognitive disabilities? How can you tell? What does that mean? Where
  would you even start?


  I’d been making websites for over 20 years, and I didn’t understand what it
  was like to use the web with a cognitive disability until I developed one.
  After treatment to remove a slow-growing brain tumor, I had a hard time using
  most websites, including the ones I built! This real-world experience gave me
  a newfound perspective on accessibility, and I learned that there’s no better
  way to understand a user’s experience than living it. It also motivated me to
  learn new techniques that provide more accessible experiences for users with
  cognitive impairments and redesign parts of my sites with a focus on cognitive
  ease.


  This session was in the Design Track.
