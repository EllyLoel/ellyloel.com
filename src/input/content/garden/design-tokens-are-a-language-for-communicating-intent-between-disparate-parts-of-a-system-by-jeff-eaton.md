highlights:
  - What I mean is that "design tokens" are a language for communicating intent between disparate parts of a system.
  - 'Calling it “design tokens” is useful because it makes clear what the purpose of the constructed language is: to communicate information that informs the design system.'
  - By definition, that’s complex and nuanced work. It’s an attempt to make explicit and dependable something that has (in most publishing systems) been implicit and inconsistent. It faces all the challenges of language.
