    What I mean is that "design tokens" are a language for communicating intent
    between disparate parts of a system.

    Calling it “design tokens” is useful because it makes clear what the purpose
    of the constructed language is: to communicate information that informs the

    explicit and dependable something that has (in most publishing systems) been
    implicit and inconsistent. It faces all the challenges of language.
