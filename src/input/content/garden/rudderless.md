excerpt: >-
  I keep thinking about this post about burnout (and the included video) from my
  web dev site.

  One of the things I’m really struggling with is that I don’t really know what
  makes me happy or gives me purpose anymore.

  I used to be able to say “turning my ideas into stuff through code.” Then,
  over time, it was “seeing my students launch and build careers they were proud
  of.”

highlights:
  - we’ve been trained to need a purpose, but just existing is enough.
