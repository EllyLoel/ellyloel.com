Lots of love to [Sophie Koonin](https://localghost.dev/blog/the-blog-questions-challenge/) and [Nic Chan](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/coming-out-of-my-cage-and-ive-been-doing-just-fine/) for tagging those of us that haven't been tagged yet ðŸ’œ

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I was going to say that I originally made this site for career reasons, which admittedly I did but honestly I wouldn't have been doing any of this if I didn't love it as much as I do. So no this is not a [professional career focused portfolio resume cv work business job capitalism](https://business-business.business/) site, it's for me.
To answer the question, I started blogging because I love sharing and I love the web.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

Hmm "manage"? I wouldn't really say I'm using a platform to manage my blog. I use Eleventy to generate the files for my blog and I use CloudFlare (ew I know) to host those files.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I guess if you'd call Gatsby a "platform", though honestly I'd call it a mistake. I also had this hosted on Netlify previously but my build used to be slow asf which meant that I was getting charged for extra build minutes all the time, which I couldn't really afford so I moved to the aforementioned ick, CloudFlare.
**A bitch has principles**, but also **a bitch is poor**, soooâ€¦

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard thatâ€™s part of your blog?

Honestly, most of the time I just end up throwing them together in my IDE. But if I weren't being so honest I'd probably say Obsidian. Though that wouldn't be a complete lie, I do actually use it sometimes, like right now! ðŸŽ‰ _but more often than not most of my writing in Obsidian is personal daily notes/diary/journal entries_.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

After watching, listening, or reading great things. I usually think of ideas while watching, listening, or reading things which then inspires me to write.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

I try to publish immediately because otherwise I end up never getting around to it.

## What are you generally interested in writing about?

## Who are you writing for?

The **_"Audience"â„¢_** but I'm trying to write more for myself.

## Whatâ€™s your favourite post on your blog?

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

## Whoâ€™s next?

As those before me did, I will also pass this along to anyone reading who hasn't yet been tagged.
