- min and max (clamp) are bad in our stylesheets
	- but can be good in user stylesheets
- (some) browsers 
	- let you set a default font size
	- let you set a minimum font size
	- should also let you set a maximum font size
- some viewport or container units being mixed in would be nice, but not too much to mess up zooming

		- https://fluid.style/type?min=2.25&max=4.5&min-bp=20&max-bp=77.5&unit=%22rem%22
	- easing like typetura talks about would be nice too
- why might users want or need to change the font size?
	- people with vision related disabilities might need to increase the default font size, and likely also set a minimum font size.
	- people with cognitive disabilities might want to be able to see more in the viewport at once so they might decrease the default font size and possibly set a maximum font size.
- should padding, margin, sizing, etc. scale with font size?

- it can be frustrating when you resize the horizontal viewport and then you lose where you were in the page because the scroll point you were at no longer corresponds with the same point in the content.

> I got into this because I found it interesting to think about interacting with an audience in terms of relationships to their preferences. I think that's the thing that drew me to CSS in the first place. [I wondered,] how far can I set aside the photons? How far down the path can I put that question of what's actually going to get rendered? [I wanted to] document the process of getting to it in a way where I can jump in and, when I adjust my user preferences, it feels like the result is right for that preference.
> So I haven't thought too much about what is the right font size for my site, and instead I've thought about what is the right way of arriving at a font size for my site. If I start from this point, where should I arrive if I start from that point? [It's about] figuring out the logic of arriving at a design instead of thinking about the design.
> But I know that I'm way out there when I think this way, and it's not the way most designers are working.
