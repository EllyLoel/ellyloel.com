excerpt: |-
  Sir Uncle Timbo (Tim Berners-Lee to you) famously designed the web for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. As mobile devices become ubiquitous, yet controlled by a de facto duopoly, how can we ensure that the web remains open, affordable, and accessible for our 3 billion neighbours who are as yet unconnected?

  This session is from the Development Track.

  About the Speaker:
  Bruce was a member of the committee that drafted the British Standard for commissioning accessible websites, and an editor of the HTML5.3 spec for the W3C. Heâ€™s also a musician and has been a Bollywood movie extra, tutor to a Princess in Thailand, a tarot reader in Istanbul and arrested (mistakenly!) for espionage in Moscow.
