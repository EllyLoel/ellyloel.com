excerpt: >-
  I've been feeling called to make more art lately. I can't stop thinking about
  potential ideas for animated Pens, that have no other purpose than to be
  looked at/and or hovered over. I'm being held back from following through on
  my ideas not only by my lack of time, but the feeling that I need to "clear
  the decks" before I can engage in such an activity.
