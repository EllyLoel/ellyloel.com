excerpt: If we, as designers, don’t fight to end the design handoff sh** show, then who will?

highlights:
  - unnecessary rework of both design and code is nearly guaranteed, and the monetary costs are high. The Dev Ops Research & Assessment Group calculates that for a medium-sized business at a medium level of technical performance, upwards of 37.8M is lost to unnecessary rework each year.
  - Forrester Research quantified how much cheaper it is to find and fix problems earlier in the build process, with costs 30 times higher if fixes happen after work ships.

    starting with a Double Diamond design process, then shifting to the build phase with iterative engineering sprints:

    In No Handoff, discovery, and development phases happen in iterations with the involvement of an interdisciplinary team:

    Discovery is not conducted solely by the UX and Design team, nor compressed into a single sprint. It takes place in cycles as the team tests the prototype with users and gains more insights.
    Definition is when decisions are made on what to prioritize, and what to work on next. Basing these decisions on the latest rounds of feedback further reduces risk.
    During Develop/Deliver stages, both design and functionality emerge side by side, informing one another. In this way, designers avoid specifying needlessly expensive directions or components or designing things in detail that don’t have value or won't be built. Engineers avoid building functionality ahead of validated business needs, and also avoid unnecessary rework due to unexpected redesigns.

    This iterative process clearly reduces risk, but other benefits are more surprising.
    - Teams develop a shared vocabulary, tooling, and cadence, closing the gap between engineering and product.
    - The voice of the end user is elevated; design and function co-emerge based on real usability needs. Traditional project handoff precludes the possibility of continuous listening, while the No Handoff Method is built around it.
    - Designers are working directly on the product design, not on throwaway artifacts.
    - Onboarding is happening continuously with end users during frequent testing phases. This further reduces the risk of users (or other stakeholders) unexpectedly rejecting the end results.
    - Iteration and frequent user testing can give Marketing and Sales teams invaluable insights in advance of releases.
    - An atmosphere of trust is built as developers and designers become comfortable openly sharing work earlier in the ideation phase without fear of reprisal for mistakes or imperfections.
    - Leadership and end-users trust that they are being heard, too, because they see and experience the results of their feedback in future iterations.
    - Trust allows teams to develop a culture of learning, continuously improving the product.
