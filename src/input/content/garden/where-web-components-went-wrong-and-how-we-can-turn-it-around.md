    I believe the solution is staring us directly in the eyes. CSS is a
    declarative language that enhances HTML. CSS is agnostic of how the HTML is
    produced. Despite this CSS is extremely ergonomic and powerful.


    The path is there for web components to be used in a responsible and
    progressive manner. We just need people with the drive and desire to find a
    better way than the hole we've dug ourselves in.


    I'm building my version of this vision with Corset. I look forward to seeing
    what other solutions arise.
