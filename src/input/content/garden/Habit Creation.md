The most impossible task for someone^[me, I am someone] with ADHD is to create a habit.

## The Habit loop

### 1. Decide on a cue

- Pick the thing that tells you it's time to do the habit (an alarm, visual reminder, another habit, etc.)
- Ideally, a cue is:
  - Clear (you won't miss it, even in a hurry)
  - Consistent (same cue every time)
  - Doable (you’ll be in a place where you can do it)

### 2. Figure out the habits routine

- Break down the habit into steps. (this will help you prepare & avoid obstacles once you begin)
- How do I know what the routine should be?
  - Consider your goals for the habit
  - Don’t be afraid to start small
  - If you need to know more, maybe build learning into your routine so it doesn’t keep you from starting
  - Rough it out! The steps will totally change, this just gives you a place to start
- After you’ve identified the routine, make a list of the stuff you’ll need to complete it! (then find/download/order/collect it so you’ll have it)

### 3. Choose your reward!

- Choose a small reward for doing the thing (to help your brain want to do it again!)
- Uh… why do I need a reward?
  - Sometimes just doing the habit is enough of an (intrinsic) reward
  - If not, add an extrinsic reward!
  - It doesn’t have to be big, but it does need to be immediate enough that the brain connects doing the thing to getting the reward!
  - So if working toward a bigger goal, consider smaller rewards (stickers! points!… smoothies!) along the way
  - If possible, work the reward into your routine

### 4. Tweak as necessary

- Keep playing with it til you find what works for you
- Ideas for tweaking:
  - Keep forgetting to do it? Try a stronger cue. (ones that stand out as weird work especially well!)
  - Feeling daunted or overwhelmed? Simplify the routine (even 1 minute/day is a great place to start!)
  - Just don’t wanna? Try a more exciting/immediate reward (and make sure you get it! The goal is for your brain to start anticipating the reward & wanting to do the thing!)
