excerpt: '@elly@front-end.social I know this feeling to well. (I’m still refining my approach, so take all of this with a grain of salt.) If there is a tonne, I would avoid being exhaustive or overly detailed. I try to limit my auditing sessions to a fixed amount of time so that it doesn’t turn into an endless task or wear on me mentally. In situations where there’s a lot, I think it’s more important to call that out, but then focus on the high impact issues. Those will help a client get a sense of where to start and the resources they’ll need for it (which might include followup audits). Also, remember: you didn’t make this mess and you don’t need to burn yourself out to fix it.'
