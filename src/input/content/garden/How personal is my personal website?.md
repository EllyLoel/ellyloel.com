~~~ callout _to be read as a conversation with my brain_

i feel very strongly that my personal website should be **personal**. it should be about me. it shouldn't just be my professional mask, it should be all of me.

## but is it?

_welllll…_ kinda,,, but no, not really. not as much as i might like to think it is.

it's not a soulless superficial professional "personal" website&trade;. but it's also not really _all_ of me. and i want it to be **all** of me.

i think i'm subconsciously censoring myself for the sake of my perceived (or maybe imagined?) audience.

as much as i like the idea of being open about everything, i think the reality of it in the context of a personal website is scarier than i thought it would be.

_that's kinda interesting._

i don't find it scary on social media or even in person honestly. on social media it feels like i can more easily blend in bc i'm not the only one up on stage. and in person—sometimes on socials too—i can gauge vibes and then match their freak.

i figured this out when i was thinking about why i don't really post that much. why i only really post about web related topics.

i love the web. but i also love other things.
so why do i feel like i can only post about the web here?

## why tho?

i think my subconscious believes my audience only wants web-related posts.

but, like, if that were true—if my audience wanted _solely_ web-related posts—there are plenty of other amazing sources they could go to for that. they wouldn't be here if that's all they were after.

they're _here_ for me.

so maybe i should give them what they want.
especially because, like i said earlier, i really like the idea of being open about everything. the more i share the more i'm able to connect with similar people. _tho it seems most other autistic trans puppygirls in tech are into rust or sysadmin not css lol._

let me know if you're a star wars lore nerd, a fan of anime & cartoons & animation of all types, a devout worshiper of yuri & GL, a lover of puppygirls, furries, the quirky and the kinky. **let's embrace the full spectrum of what makes us unique and unapologetically ourselves.**
