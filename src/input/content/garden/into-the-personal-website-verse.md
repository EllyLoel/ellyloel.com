    Personal websites are the backbone of the independent Web of creators. Even
    after all those years, they remain a vital part of what makes the web the
    most remarkable and open medium to date. We shouldn’t take this for granted,
    though. If we don’t pay enough attention and care about the open web enough,
    we might lose this valuable asset. So let us protect the Web as a source of
    inspiration, diversity, creativity, and community. Let us maintain what we
    have and work together to make this little part of the magic of the Web
    sparkle even brighter. Let us help new members of the community to start
    their journey. Let us build, prototype, publish, and connect.
