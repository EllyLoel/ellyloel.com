  Much of my career as a web designer has been spent, quite happily, working
  alongside programmers, engineers, people with computer science…

    We need to identify exploitation. While there are some gleeful Full Stack
    Developers, many are computer scientists given too many responsibilities,
    and over things for which they are not willing or qualified to be held
    accountable.We need to address the undervaluing of HTML and CSS for what it
    is: gender bias. Even though we wouldn’t have computer science without
    pioneering women, interloping men have claimed it for themselves. Anything
    less than ‘real programming’ is now considered trivial, silly, artsy,
    female. That attitude needs to eat a poisoned ass.We need to revisit the
    separation of concerns principle. We simply can’t afford for people to have
    to know everything just to do something. It’s good that we conceptualize
    designs in terms of self-contained components now, but that can be a mental
    model without being a technology-specific land-grab.Most of all, we need to
    educate people who don’t code at all just how many different things
    different types of code can do, and how different each is to understand and
    write. Hopefully, this way, more of us will be writing the kind of code that
    suits us best, and not spending our time anxious and demoralized because we
    don’t know what we’re doing, or we simply have too much on our plate. That’s
    not to say that if you do take to JS, CSS, HTML, SQL, and C# you shouldn’t
    be writing all of them if you‘d like to and you have enough time!
