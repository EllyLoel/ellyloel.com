In case you haven't already heard, this blog questions challenge was originally started by [Ava](https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/) and then adapted for everyone by [Kev](https://kevquirk.com/blog/blog-questions-challenge).

Lots of love to [Sophie](https://localghost.dev/blog/the-blog-questions-challenge/) and [Nic](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/coming-out-of-my-cage-and-ive-been-doing-just-fine/) for tagging those of us that haven't been tagged yet ðŸ’œ

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I was going to say that I originally made this site for career reasons, which admittedly I did but honestly I wouldn't have been doing any of this if I didn't love it as much as I do. So no this is not a [professional career focused portfolio resume cv work business job capitalism](https://business-business.business/) site, it's for me.

To answer the question, I started blogging because I love sharing and I love the web.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

Hmm "manage"? I wouldn't really say I'm using a platform to manage my blog. I use Eleventy to generate the files for my blog and I use CloudFlare (ew I know) to host those files.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I guess if you'd call Gatsby a "platform", though honestly I'd call it a mistake. I also had this hosted on Netlify previously but my build used to be slow asf which meant that I was getting charged for extra build minutes all the time, which I couldn't really afford so I moved to the aforementioned ick, CloudFlare.

**A bitch has principles**, but also **a bitch is poor**, soooâ€¦

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard thatâ€™s part of your blog?

Honestly, most of the time I just end up throwing them together in my IDE. But if I weren't being so honest I'd probably say Obsidian. Though that wouldn't be a complete lie, I do actually use it sometimes, like right now! ðŸŽ‰ _but more often than not most of my writing in Obsidian is personal daily notes/diary/journal entries_.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

After watching, listening, or reading great things. I usually think of ideas while I'm doing those things which then inspires me to write.

Of course the shower is also another prime time for inspiration, though I usually forget my ideas before I've hopped out ðŸ¥² *same goes for the ever so rare toilet trips without my phone* lmao.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

I try to publish immediately because otherwise I end up never getting around to it.

**Update:** It's been like a week since I wrote that sentence and I magically did end up coming back to this post ðŸ˜± aren't we all so glad for that!

Anyway, maybe I shouldn't doubt myself so much. *Though I do have like 10 other posts that have been sitting around for much longer than this one* lol[^1].

[^1]: If you wanna get a sneak peak at them you can just look at the GitHub repo for this site, they're the ones marked as drafts.

## What are you generally interested in writing about?

I tend towards writing more technical things, like talking about a new web platform feature or a issue I've solved, etc. But I think I want to do less of that, and more creative or personal writing because I find that's what connects with others the most and it's what I enjoy writing the most.

## Who are you writing for?

Honestly usually it's for the **_"Audience"â„¢_** aka the people who usually read my writing and who I interact with most. But the more I've thought about that the more I've realised that the best way to do that is to write for myself because that's the kind of writing I enjoy most from others. There's just something so lovely about reading something that someone has clearly written for themself first and foremost. In the AI-slop filled web we find ourselves stuck in today reading something filled with so much care and love and soul is truly wonderful.

## Whatâ€™s your favourite post on your blog?

Well [Front-end developmentâ€™s identity crisis](/front-end-development-s-identity-crisis/) is definitely far and away my most popular post, and I definitely love it, though I feel like the [updated version for my talk at Web Directions Code24](/web-directions-code24-front-end-developments-identity-crisis/) is even better.

On an even more raw note [How do I survive?](/how-do-i-survive/) is great and lead to lots of wonderful messages from people.

And then the most underrated would have to be [What I want/need from a job](/what-i-want-need-from-a-job/). At the beginning of this year that I updated it and basically completely changed it. The lists in the first half are the same but after that I added a whole nother post's worth of content!

Can I pick a favourite? Ehhh,,, probably not.

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

I'm constantly redesigning this site, but maybe some day I'll fall prey to a full-wipe hard-reset kind of redesign, for now my will power is managing to hold myself back from something that drastic *how ever tempting it may be* lol.

Definitely not planning to move, Eleventy is fucking awesome. Only thing that might cause me to move would be wanting to add more complex interactive features like say maybe memberships and auth or something like that. In that situation I'd probably go for Astro, but like I said I love Eleventy and I'm not looking to move.

I'm always working on new features, one of the last ones I added was basically a complete overhaul of the force-directed pages and links graph for my digital garden. That was huge and super complex, it was really interesting to try my best to make something like that accessible to all, and I think I did a pretty good job!

## Whoâ€™s next?

As those before me did, I will also pass this along to anyone reading who hasn't yet been tagged.
