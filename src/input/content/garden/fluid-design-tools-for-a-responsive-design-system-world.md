excerpt: >-
  Modern design tools are great, but their efforts to reflect the responsive
  reality of web design have been lacking. Too often, they’re stuck in static
  design thinking, or adaptive layouts like mobile, tablet, and desktop.


  The rise of design systems has helped, allowing for easy preview of responsive
  patterns. But our design tools aren’t yet equipped to allow designers to move
  easily from design to code. Where are the tools that allow for truly fluid
  layouts? What would they even look like?


  In this talk, Jason will look at how our design processes have changed, how
  design tools should integrate with design systems, and how close we can get to
  an ideal fluid design tool today.
