  I'm constantly reminded of this. Just because I really want to get involved with web standards doesn't mean I can. I simply don't have the time because I'm not paid to do it.

  On a related note, you should [help fund my wonderful friend Mia's work on logical shorthands!](https://opencollective.com/oddbird-open-source/contribute/css-logical-shorthands-86141)
excerpt: The phrase 'Open Standards' is widely used but not well-understood. Let's take a look at what openness in standards is, with a focus on whether and how it helps to legitimise the design and maintenance of the Internet.

    First, just because someone has the theoretical ability to participate, it doesn’t mean that they actually can. Standards work has a notoriously steep learning curve; being effective requires great technical expertise, significant time, and frequent international travel to build influence, relationships and understanding. Yes, SDOs use online tools like mailing lists, videoconferencing, and GitHub to allow remote participation, but they are a poor substitute for face-to-face interaction, hallway discussions and sharing a meal (and, often, a drink). And, even people who follow Internet standards full time aren’t aware of every development in every specification, because there’s simply too much going on.

    Together, this means that the number of people actually paying attention to a particular standards development can be quite small, unless it captures the broader imagination. It also means that only those with sufficient incentive to invest resources will participate in a long-term effort.
