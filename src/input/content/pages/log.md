Started working my way through Sara Soueidan's [Practical Accessibility](https://practical-accessibility.today/) course, and I'm absolutely loving it so far.

Trying to help improve our design systems practice at Portable. Governance and direction are my top priorities.

After some discussions, we've realised that it's not so much the "Portable Design System" as the "Portable Design System Design System". Design System<sup>2</sup>. As it's a Design System for making Design Systems.

Tagged, versioned and released [PDS Styles](https://github.com/PortableStudios/PDS-Styles) as a package.

## March, 2023

I'm no longer a junior! I'm now officially a mid-level developer, or just a developer, but really as y'all know, _I'm actually a Design Engineer_.

Had the great pleasure of taking part in a [Crafting Type](https://craftingtype.com/) workshop, where I got to start _crafting_ my very own typeface! Many thanks to [Thomas Phinney](https://www.thomasphinney.com/) and [Wayne Thompson](https://www.atf.com.au/).

Helped build a website for [Victorian Law Week](https://www.viclawweek.org.au/) (_yay!_) but it was on WebFlow (_oh nooo_).

Still working on building out the Portable Design System, things are slow moving working as a one woman show.

Working on building out the Portable Design System, starting with [Styles](https://github.com/PortableStudios/PDS-Styles) and [Docs](https://github.com/PortableStudios/PDS-Docs).

## November, 2022

So Twitter is a shit show lmao, I'm on Mastodon now [@ellyloel@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@ellyloel)

I did a presentation on [Solid JS](https://www.solidjs.com/), going from zero knowledge to trying to give a presentation in 2 days is harrrdddddd. Note to self for next time, make slides, you will forget what you want to talk about otherwise {% emoji "üòÇ", "Crying with laughter" %}.

I also did a presentation on the future of CSS, covering what new things are usable now and what will be usable soon‚Ñ¢.

I'm looking into building a component library with [WebC](https://github.com/11ty/webc), though one of the key usage situation will be in WordPress so I need to figure out how/when to run the compile step.

## October, 2022

I got to take part in Portable's [Ethical Human-Centred Design Foundations](https://portable.com.au/hcd-training) training session.

Working on matching our [figma2theme](https://portable.com.au/hcd-training) tool to the [Design Tokens Format](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/) so that we can use more tools with our tokens, like [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/).

## September, 2022

Been learning a lot about accessibility lately and how sadly a lot of the more complex accessibility focused native HTML elements aren't yet very accessible (details & dialog).

## August, 2022

I'm officially an AWS certified cloud practitioner, what ever that means {% emoji "üòÇ", "Crying with laughter" %}

Looks like it's that time again, the clock has struck, and now I am 21 {% emoji "ü§Ø", "Mind blown" %}

Want to share my love of CSS

Want to get involved with W3C community groups

Want to start using Web Components more

## May 2022

Lots of people movements makes me think about moving

[Helped Rachel Nabors out with AWS Amplify user research](https://twitter.com/rachelnabors/status/1523185823717281799) and because of that got access to their [Web animation essentials course](https://courses.rachelnabors.com/p/web-animation-essentials-css-animations-and-transitions)

Made some Web Components √ó frameworks showcases:

- [Web Components √ó React Experimental](https://codesandbox.io/s/web-components-x-react-experimental-068ghv?file=/src/App.js)
- [Web Components √ó React](https://codesandbox.io/s/web-components-x-react-qp0gik?file=/src/App.js:1129-1196)
- [Web Components √ó Vue](https://codesandbox.io/s/web-components-x-vue-tf14cd?file=/src/App.vue)

Working on rebuilding my website using Next.JS

Wondering how people get to be in amazing roles where they get to do things like create video and articles about the web and be members of the CSS working group and many more amazing things.

## April 2022

Blogging platform, struggling to choose whether going with a ready to go third party platform or going fully custom is better. I tried weighing up the options in order of least to most "custom" (self hosted/self designed/self coded):

1.  **Medium/Dev.to/Hashnode `(Third party platform)`**
    - Completely owned by a third party
    - Ready to go right now, zero setup
2.  **Obsidian Publish `(Personal third party platform)`**
    - Owned by a third party but customisable to an extent
3.  **Framer Sites `(No/low code)`**
    - Hosted by a third party but fully customisable (as much as a wysiwyg drag and drop can be)
4.  **Ghost `(OSS CMS)`**
    - Self hosted option
    - Can be setup with pre-made themes or headless with a custom frontend
5.  **Markdown `(Custom everything)`**
    - Fully custom, what my "old" (current) setup is (Gatsby w/ MDX)
    - The sky is the limit, though that can be dangerous when it comes to spending more time coding the platform than actually writing
    - Allows me to keep other aspects of my site integrated all on the same platform (AMA, Tools, Resume, etc.)
    - If I choose this option should I stick with Gatsby or continue switching to Next or use something like Astro?

Web Components are awesome!!!

every-layout.dev looks really interesting

## March 2022

Polypane seems awesome

## February 2022

## January 2022

Scrimba Podcast episode came out! {% emoji "üéâ" %}

I also made a personal link shortener using Netlify redirects, so all I have to do is run: `shorten https://twitter.com/ellyloel twitter` which automatically updates the redirects file and pushes up the changes so then we get [https://elly.to/twitter](https://elly.to/twitter)

Started CSS-for-JS Devs by Josh W Comeau

## December 2021

I remixed a cool [Glitch In Bio](https://glitch.com/glitch-in-bio) on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) for my partner [nervous ghost](https://twitter.com/nervousgh0st) (https://nervousgh0st.glitch.me/). The combination of simplicity and customisability makes it approachable for anyone. I was able to go in and make more advanced tweaks to set it up, but if my partner ever wants to add or change things they will easily be able to without having to worry about the more complex side.

I finally got all of the bug fixes and small tweaks for my website shipped. Most of the changes were to do with parts of the [digital garden](/garden/) (graph, markdown processing, link capturing, etc.) as well as some redirects 'n' stuff.

## November 2021

I've been working on a presentation about neurodiversity with a few colleagues, which we'll be presenting internally on the 6th of December.

I've also been working on fixing up this website as there's been plenty of big & small bugs plaguing the site.
