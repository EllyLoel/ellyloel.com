## [Web Directions Code](https://webdirections.org/code/): [Front-end development’s identity crisis](https://webdirections.org/code/speakers/elly-loel.php)

> I have a dilemma. I'm trying to find a job but the job I'm looking for no longer exists. I'm a front-end developer. Which to me means I work on the user interface of the website. But now in our industry front-end means the same thing as full-stack. Front-end developer job descriptions include many back-end duties. There are almost always even more back-end duties than there are front-end. This is because the industry has devalued front-end development. To the point where it's no longer considered complex or time-consuming enough to be a full-time job.
>
> In this talk, we're going to go through the issues with full-stack and front-end development, and then we'll figure out what title best describes the people left behind by the new definition of front-end.
