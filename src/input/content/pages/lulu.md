A collection of images of our lovely little lady Lu. {% emoji "üêà‚Äç‚¨õ" %}

Knowledge for image descriptions:
- Lulu is our little black cat
- Brodie is my partner, they are a short, white, non-binary person with black hair and a septum piercing
- I am Elly, *though you probably already know that seeing as you're on my website*, I'm a tall, white, trans woman, with blonde hair and dimples.

I hope the alt text does these wonderful images justice! Some alt text references previous images, so it's best to look through them in order.
