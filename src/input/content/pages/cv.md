### Portable - Developer

<span class="[ badge ][ neutral pill ]">Sep 2021-Present</span>

- **Built impactful websites** ‚Äî I have successfully developed a diverse range of websites for various clients, including brochure sites, blogs, information-heavy sites, learning material sites, and marketing sites. These clients have included government organisations, non-governmental organisations, non-profit organisations, and corporate entities. My expertise primarily lies in front-end development, utilising semantic HTML, CSS, and ü§è JavaScript, but I also have experience in back-end development and dev-ops using PHP, Docker, and other relevant technologies, in addition to being competent on the command line. I have assisted clients in establishing or upgrading their online presence, ensuring their websites are accessible to a wide audience. I have acquired knowledge in various web frameworks and libraries, enabling me to be a T-shaped developer with a broad foundation of skills, specialising in front-end development and accessibility.
- **Audited for Accessibility** ‚Äî I have played a key role in promoting digital inclusivity by conducting thorough accessibility audits and producing detailed reports that ultimately resulted in improved website accessibility for clients. Using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM), I ensured a standardised, comprehensive evaluation process was achieved during audits. In addition to identifying issues, I explained the issues to our clients so they could make informed decisions about the remediation process. Notably, I successfully conducted accessibility audits, produced reports, and resolved issues for the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission (VEOHRC) and Bank Australia.
- **Championed design system** ‚Äî I reestablished the Portable design system by recommending the most appropriate tools for its management. In addition, I enhanced existing features and introduced new features to the open source tools used to deliver the design system. As part of this, I implemented CSS custom properties (variables) as an output format for Figma2theme, and refactored it to make it simpler to add more output formats in future. I conducted regular one-on-one meetings with designers engaged in the design system to collaborate on redesigning token taxonomy. Additionally, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various design token management tools. Collectively, these efforts expanded the design system‚Äôs use by projects with diverse tech stacks and have made it easier for developers and designers alike to use and understand.
- **Shared front-end knowledge** ‚Äî I have played a significant role in driving the improvement of front-end web development and design practices within my teams. I am passionate about teaching and committed to sharing knowledge, and have excelled at offering insight and instruction on front-end web development, with an aim to create a culture of continuous learning. I have done this by consistently sharing valuable articles, resources, and tools related to front-end development, developing the overall skill set of my team members. I have also taken a leadership role in organising workshops and presentations focused on the latest HTML, CSS, and other web platform features. These initiatives have not only kept the team up to date on cutting-edge technologies but have also greatly improved our efficiency and proficiency in utilising the latest advancements in web development.
- **Advocated for accessibility** ‚Äî As a strong advocate for accessibility, I played a pivotal role in promoting a culture of inclusivity throughout the organisation. My primary focus was on educating developers and designers on the effective use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers, dictation software, keyboard-only controls, screen magnification, head/eye tracking, high/low contrast modes, etc. As a result of providing important insights, I successfully increased awareness and equipped the team to address potential accessibility challenges during the design and development phases. In addition, I actively participate in web development and accessibility communities through social media and various blogs to stay up to date with best practices. In the spirit of fostering professional development, I regularly shared valuable articles, resources, and tools, contributing to our collective commitment to ensuring our websites are accessible to all users.
- **Supported long term client projects** ‚Äî I am committed to delivering exceptional results not only in the completion of projects but also in providing support for our long-term clients. I have successfully resolved support issues reported by clients and users in a timely manner, ensuring a smooth user experience and maintaining high client satisfaction levels backed up by repeated positive client feedback. Further to this, I have played a critical role in improving project functionality by incorporating new features based on client feedback. Notable contributions include rebuilding and redesigning website navigation, addressing accessibility concerns, and the overall enhancement of functionality and usability. In doing so, I have consistently met and often exceeded client expectations, while also contributing to project innovation by adopting a client-focused approach while adapting to evolving project requirements.
