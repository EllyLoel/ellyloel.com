This page was inspired by [Carolina Gilabert's salary page](https://carol.gg/salary/).

She describes it well:

> When looking for a job, it can be tricky to know what to ask for in terms of salary, especially for under represented minorities, who are routinely underlevelled and underpaid. So I thought it would be useful to share my salary history since becoming a software engineer, in hopes that it will help someone at some point.
