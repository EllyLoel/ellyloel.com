An on & off log of what I'm currently doing/interested in. Slower paced than a twitter feed but less permanent then an [about](/about/) page.
[Now pages](https://nownownow.com/about) are becoming more common, you should make one for yourself!

## Last update (Febuary, 2025)

I was interviewed for the [Lookahead's 'Ducks in a Row' newsletter](https://lookahead.cmail19.com/t/t-e-shrurjt-yhtudyjrv-hl/#:~:text=We%20love%20attending!-,Friends,Let%20us%20introduce%20you%20to%20Elly%20Loel.,-Introduce%20yourself!). It was great fun, I love answering questions lol.

Still tinkering with the structural overhaul of the website. Also lots of tidying up and just removing general cruft, like updating dependencies, removing unneeded dependencies, etc. (Finally on 11ty v3! ðŸŽ‰)

Helped Brodie table at [Kaiga Anime Convention](https://www.kaigaconvention.com.au/upcoming-events/melbourne-pop-up-artist-alley-2025).
