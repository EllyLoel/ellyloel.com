I tried using the W3C WAI's [tool for developing an accessibility statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/) but it didn't really work in the context of a personal site. I'm not a business, I don't have policies or a mission statement, being completely honest trying to fill that out made me feel weeeeeeird af. That's because [I am a poem I am not software](https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/). I'm a human not a business, so **I care**, I really honestly give a shit.

So that being said, let's get into this non-standard, more personal accessibility statement.

The content on this page was adapted from Eric Bailey's work on [the a11y project's](https://www.a11yproject.com/accessibility-statement/) and [his personal website's](https://ericwbailey.website/accessibility-statement/) accessibility statement.

I am committed to making sure this site functions for the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. I follow principles of [web accessibility](https://github.com/Heydon/principles-of-web-accessibility) and [inclusive design](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.info/).

I aim to conform to WCAG 2.2 AA (and some AAA) but first and foremost I'm focused on making this site as accessible and usable as possible for all. WCAG is a starting point, and I treat it as such, compliance shouldn't get in the way of improving real people's experience.

Some of the things I'm doing to make sure the site is as accessible and usable as possible are:
- Using time-tested, stable and interoperable technology based on open standards to help ensure the site can be accessed by the widest range of devices as possible.
- Continuously manually testing the site for accessibility issues.
- Hosting my code on a public repository, allowing anyone with the interest and capability to inspect and modify it.
- Striving to keep the interactions and user interface unambiguous and easy to understand.
- Striving to keep the download size small and memory footprint light.
- Supporting magnified and zoomed displays, as well as custom typefaces and themes set by users.
- Respecting expressed users preferences for things such as reduced motion, dark mode, etc.
- Maintaining a colour palette with good contrast ratios values to keep content legible.
- Using distinct, obvious focus states for all interactive elements.
- Using clear, inclusive, non-ableist language in my writing.

The code powering this site is standards-compliant HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG. Any person using a past, present, or future browser that honors these standards should be capable of navigating this site.

Although I cannot guarantee that all content linked to, or embedded on this site is fully accessible, I try to choose sites and services that are as accessible and usable as possible.

I have tested this site on a slew of operating systems, browsers, assistive technologies, screen sizes, internet speeds, and device speeds.
