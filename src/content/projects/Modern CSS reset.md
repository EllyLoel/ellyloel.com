**A reset is more than a reset.**

Sure if you wanna actually just reset things and nothing else then here you go:

```css
*,
*::after,
*::before {
	all: initial !important;
}
```

## There are always some opinions in resets

- [ ] add examples

> Nicolas Gallagher and I started writing normalize.css together. I named and created the normalize.css repository with the help of Paul Irish and Ben Alman. I transferred the repository to Necolas, who turned it into a “household” CSS library.
>
> Later, I resumed authorship of normalize.css with Luciano Battagliero. Together, we tagged, deprecated, and removed “opinionated” styles — styles developers often prefer but which do not fix bugs or “normalize” browser differences.
>
> Later, Necolas resumed authorship and the issue of whether to include or omit the opinionated styles forced us to split.
>
> I continue working on the normalize.css project, currently under the “csstools” tag. I hope one day our differences are resolved and the projects are one again.

> A secondary reminders.css with more opinionated or situational remedies that should be reviewed and considered on a case-by-case basis.
