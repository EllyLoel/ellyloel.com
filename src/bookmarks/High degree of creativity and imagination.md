> "High degree of creativity and imagination. People with ADHD—at any age—often possess intellectual effervescence. Unfortunately, this natural sparkle can be snuffed out by years of criticism, reprimands, redirection, lack of appreciation, and repeated disappointments, frustrations, and outright failures."

— [[ADHD 2.0 by Edward Hallowell & John Ratey]]
