> "Restlessness, especially in boys and men. Woolgathering, especially in girls and women. Because they tend not to be hyperactive or disruptive, females of all ages remain the most undiagnosed group. You have to be a savvy parent, teacher, spouse, supervisor, or doctor to pick up inattentive, non-hyperactive ADHD in a girl or woman."
