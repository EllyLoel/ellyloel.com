If you made a 1% increase every day for a year, you'd be 37 times better by the end of the year.

You don't need to make one earth-shattering improvement, just lots of small ones.
Habits are the compound interest of life.
Doing personal study on one day won't do much, but if you do it for a month or a year it could change your life.
The effects of your habits multiply
It's easy to let bad habits slide because you don't immediately see the negative effects.
Making a choice that's 1% better or 1% worse seems insignificant in the moment but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices make up the difference between who you are and who you could be.
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
Net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits.
Weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits.
Knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.
Clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits.
Time magnifies the margin between success and failure, it will multiply what ever you feed it.
Good habits make time your ally, bad habits make time your enemy.
Productivity compounds
Accomplishing one more task is a small feat on any given day but it counts for a lot over an entire career.
The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater.
The more tasks you can handle without thinking the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.
Knowledge compounds
Learning one new idea won't make you a genius but a commitment to life long learning can be transformative.
Each book your read not only teaches you something new but opens up other ways of thinking about old ideas.
Negative thoughts compound.
The more you think of yourself and worthless, stupid or ugly the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way; you get trapped in a thought loop.
What progress is really like.
Break through moments a usually the result of many previous actions which unlock the potential to unless a major change.
Forget about goals focus on systems instead.
Systems are the processes that lead to your goals.
