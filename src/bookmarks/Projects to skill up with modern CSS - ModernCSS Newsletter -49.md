> "**here are some practical problems (in no particular order) to try to solve that will help you learn CSS more deeply.**
> * style a `<progress>` bar
> * ensure icons are visible in `forced-colors` mode
> * make a card layout friendly to both left-to-write and right-to-left writing modes
> * handle for round avatars of different sizes and different transparencies
> * develop a grid of logos that appears uniform in size even with different uploaded logo sizes and transparencies
> * change the color of list bullets/numbers
> * define accessible focus styles
> * create and apply a color scheme that adapts for dark and light modes
> * modify the size, color, and position of text underlines
> * embellish a headline using pseudo elements
> * crop an image into an irregular shape and apply a modified color effect
> * "cut out" an icon from the element it is attached to (the page background is visible around it)
> * ensure light text over a light image (like in a page header) is legible
> * swap a navigation bar logo from left to centered position depending on viewport size
> * apply an animation that adheres to `prefers-reduced-motion`
> * smooth scroll to an anchor and adjust the anchor's scroll position below the top of the viewport
> * adapt font sizes, padding, and margin without media queries
> * add an icon to links that are external to your URL, or that lead to a downloadable resource (ex. `pdf`, `doc`)
> * re-arrange a grid layout based on container size
> * write styles for a blog/news article that considers spacing relationships between different content element types (ex. `h2` followed by a `p`, `blockquotes`), hierarchy relationships (feature image vs. in-content image vs. `figure`), and embellishments (ex. `hr`, `strong`, `code`)
> * give a `label` a style when the `input` that follows it is invalid
> * change the color of `radio` buttons and `checkboxes`, adapting to light or dark modes"
