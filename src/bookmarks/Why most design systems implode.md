> Design systems go stale fast Imagine the frustration of using a library with stale documentation. Brad points out stale documentation as the primary pitfall for design system teams: "They treat [design systems] as this off-to-the-side thing… Chores suck, so teams eventually stop updating reference documentation. Once the documentation ceases to reflect the reality of the product, the effort is dead in the water." If you could auto-generate documentation from code, that would ensure the production UI and docs stay in sync. When you build components in Storybook, you naturally capture all their use cases as stories. Those stories can also be used to auto-generate interactive API documentation. What’s more, you can add more context by writing Markdown or embedding design assets.
