> "Generosity. As painful as the distortions we carry around can be, we also carry around a pocketful of miracles, a positive energy that comes and goes. But when it comes, we are the most generous people you’ll ever find, the most optimistic, the most enthusiastic. Yes, ironically, although we tend to reject help from others (see above!), we are the ones who offer the shirt off our back to the person who needs it, whether we know them or not. It’s why so many of us excel in sales. We can be charismatic, infectiously funny, persuasive, and just what you need if you’re feeling low."
