> "**Naming Conventions**
> - Definitive naming (Avoid!!!)
> - Semantic naming (Describe color intent)
> - Contextual naming (Describe color use)
>
> **Combining Semantic+Contextual**
> - Semantic for Designers
> - Contextual for Engineers
>
> **Color weights**
> - Semantic+weighted (tints/shades with numbers)
> - Meaningful/useful weights (Use of L\* values)
> - Incidental vs. Essential weights (WCAG compliance)"
