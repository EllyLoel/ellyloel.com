## Me

Well hello there! My name is [Elly Loel](https://ellyloel.com/). I'm a developer, designer and writer, currently working as a junior developer at Portable!
I run a [newsletter](http://newsletter.ellyloel.com/) and love [sharing interesting things](https://elly.to/twitter) to help people become better coders! In my spare time, I love building mechanical keyboards, watching cartoons and anime, and hanging out with my partner Brodie and our cat Lulu. üêà‚Äç‚¨õ
