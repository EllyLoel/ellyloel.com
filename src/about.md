## Who am I?

Well hello there! My name is [Elly Loel](https://ellyloel.com/). I'm a developer, designer and writer, currently working as a junior developer at Portable!
I love sharing interesting things so check out my socials or my newsletter! In my spare time, I love building mechanical keyboards, watching cartoons and anime, and hanging out with my partner [Brodie](https://nervousghost.com) and our cat Lulu. :black_cat:
