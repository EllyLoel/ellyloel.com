#About

Well hello there! My name is Elly Loel. I'm a developer, designer and writer, currently working as a junior developer at Portable! 

I run a newsletter and love sharing interesting things to help people become better coders! In my spare time, I love building mechanical keyboards, watching cartoons and anime, and hanging out with my partner Brodie and our cat Lulu. 🐈‍⬛

You might have heard me on the Scrimba podcast with Alex Booker or seen me in Portable’s How to land your first tech job event.
